    "details": "Kuwait is a hereditary emirate with an unelected head of state (Emir of Kuwait). The Constitution has elements of a presidential and parliamentary system of government.  The Emir's powers are defined in the Constitution, which include, among others, appointing the prime minister, who in turn chooses the cabinet (government). The Emir is the head of state and commander of the military, with extensive competencies, who along with his cabinet constitutes the executive branch. The Emir is also part of the legislative branch along with the parliament - National Assembly. Upon the death of the Emir, the crown prince succeeds.\n\nThe parliament can be dismissed by the Emir, which should be followed by elections within two months. Although the constitution grants the Emir very substantial power, the constitution also provides for some political participation of the citizens through elections to the unicameral National Assembly, as  the main legislative branch.  Fifty members of the National Assembly are elected for four-year terms by popular vote using a single non-transferable vote system. An additional 15 deputies are the members of the cabinet.  The National Assembly has the power to remove government ministers from their post.The cabinet ministers have the same rights as the elected MPs, with the following two exceptions: they do not participate in the work of committees and they cannot vote when an interpolation leads to a no-confidence vote against one of the cabinet members.\n\nThe Emir appoints all the judges. In each administrative district, there are Courts of First Instance; then there is a Court of Appeals; and Cassation Court. A Constitutional Court interprets the constitution and deals with disputes related to the consitutionality of laws. ",

The voter must also present a civil identification card that shows the person's address. If the certificate of registration was lost, provided the voter's name is on the voter list, he/she can vote. The head of the polling committee hands each voter a ballot paper and the voters goes to one of the areas designated for voting in secret inside the polling hall. After the voter marks the ballot, he/she returns it to the chairperson who puts it in the ballot box. The polling clerk then enters a mark in the voter list in front of the name of the voter who cast his/her ballot to indicate the voter has voted.  A voter who is unable to independently mark the ballot can state his/her choice orally so that only the members of the polling committee can hear it (or just the chairperson) and the chairperson marks the voter's choice on the ballot paper and puts it in the ballot box."
