Per the Constitution, there may be more ministers (and thus ex-officio members) so long as the number of ministers does not exceed one-third of the total assembly. \n\nThe highest courts in Kuwait are the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court.

The head of the polling committee hands each voter a ballot paper and the voters goes to one of the areas designated for voting in secret inside the polling hall. After the voter marks the ballot, he/she returns it to the chairperson who puts it in the ballot box. The polling clerk then enters a mark in the voter list in front of the name of the voter who cast his/her ballot to indicate the voter has voted.  A voter who is unable to independently mark the ballot can state his/her choice orally so that only the members of the polling committee can hear it (or just the chairperson) and the chairperson marks the voter's choice on the ballot paper and puts it in the ballot box."

However, the Supreme Board of Elections did not exercise oversight over the lower election boards and failed to produce manuals or voting education materials. Overall transparency in the election administration was also lacking, including the election board's failure to publish all its decisions as required by law.  Upon governors' requests based on security considerations, the election board relocated and merged a number of polling stations affecting some 120,000 voters in 16 provinces.The election board did not publish the numbers and locations of the polling stations moved, the number of voters affected, or the justification for these decisions. Some of these changes were done after the legal deadline. The measures resulted in some voters having to travel several kilometres to vote, and voters were not informed in a systematic manner of their new places for voting.  Various stakeholers noted that the affected communities opposed these measures and expressed concerns that the measures were aimed at lowering the voter turnout in areas considered to be HDP strongholds. Complaints were lodged against the decisions.",

The Overseas Electoral Register includes the records of Turkish citizens residing abroad taken from the address registration system of the General Directorate of Population and Citizenship Affairs by the General Directorate of Electoral Register.  Overseas voting is implemented by several methods: in-person at foreign representations (or other designated locations), at customs gates, and by-mail. Electronic voting for overseas voters can also be implemented by decision of the Supreme Board of Elections, in which case voters are to be provided with passwords and similar safety measures are to be taken to prevent multiple voting. If electronic voting is used, it is to begin 30 days before election day and end 17:00 on election day. The Supreme Board of Elections, based on the opinion of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, determines separately or individually, the voting methods either using electronic or paper ballots, considering the type of elections and conditions of the country. The foreign representations (and other designated places) where voting will take place in-person are determined by the Supreme Board of Elections, based on the opinion Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Overseas voters may vote in the presidential election and the proportional part of the parliamentary election (not majoritarian elections.) For by-mail overseas voting, specially manufactured ballot papers and coloured voting envelopes are used, which are sent to the addresses of the overseas voters five days before the election.  One small envelope carries the seal of the foreign district election board in which the ballot is included. This envelope is to be put in another medium envelope in which the words \"foreign district election board Ankara/Turkiye\" is written and this envelope is put in a third larger envelope on which the the voters' foreign address is written. After marking the ballot paper with an 'X' beside the column of the preferred political party or presidential candidate, the voter puts the ballot paper in the small envelope and closes it. This envelope is put in the  medium envelope which is then sealed and the voter sends it in a way to arrive at the foreign district election board at the latest at 17:00 on election day. For in-person voting at polling stations located at  foreign representations (and other designated places), secrecy of the vote must be respected.  The ballots and envelopes for overseas voting in-person are specially  manufactured in special colours. When the voters comes to vote, the president of the ballot box committee checks the voters identification document and whether the voter has already voted, over a computer supported central electoral roll system. If the voter has not yet voted, he/she is given a stamped ballot paper and the 'yes' or 'preference' stamp. After voting, the voter signs on the electoral roll next to his/her name.  The sealed envelopes with the ballots are put in a bag along with the other voting materials, and sent to the overseas district election board for counting. For voting at customs gates, the period of voting begins 45 days before election day and ends 17:00 on election day; voting hours are 8:00 to 17:00. Specially manufactured ballot papers and envelopes in special colours are used for customs gate voting. The designated customs gates are determined by the Supreme Board of Elections. Secrecy of the vote must be guaranteed.  When a voter comes to a customs gate to vote, the president of the ballot box committee checks his/her identity document and that he/she has not already voted, as indicated on the computer supported central electoral roll. The voter is given a stamped ballot paper and a 'yes' or 'preference' stamp, and enters the secret voting area and completes the voting process. The voter then signs the electoral roll.  Ballots are counted at the customs gates."

Poll workers and law enforcement officers are provided documentation from the distriction election board to vote at the polling station to which they are assigned (MPs and candidates can vote at any polling station by presenting their voter document). The names of the above-noted persons are added at the end of the voter list by the ballot box committee. Voters who are pregnant, ill or diabled did not have to wait in line at the polling station.  One by one, the voters registered in the voter list are to prove their identity by official documents shown to the president of the ballot box committee; the list of acceptable identfication documents is  determined by the Supreme Board of Elections prior to the election day. Proxy voting is not permitted. The president finds the name fo the voter in the voter list and gives him/her one ballot paper and envelope, as well as 'yes' or 'preference' stamp, guides him/her to the place for secret voting if there is more than one cabin and tells the voters to go out of the cabin after folding the ballot and inserting it in the envelope. The voter must then go directly to the place for secret voting with the ballot/envelope. Nobody is allowed inside the secret voting area unless the previous voter leaves; voters who remain inside the cabin for more than a reasonable time are to be warned by the president. Voters who do not leave the area despite warning are removed from the cabin. Voters are not allowed inside the secret voting area with phones, cameras, audio or video recorders or any other communication tools. These kind of devices are to be turned off and presented to the president before voting; the devices are returned to voters after voting. The voter casts his/her vote by affixing the stamp inside the circule belonging to the candidate of preference. After folding the ballot paper and placing it in the envelope, the voter leaves the voting cabin and personally inserts the envelope inside the ballot box. The voter returns the stamp back tothe president. Voters with disabilties can be assisted by a relative registered at the polling station or by another voter. The president returns the voter's ID card to the voter and has the voter put his/her signature on the voter list. If the voter cannot sign, the fingerprint of the left thumb is taken or other finger if necessary. After voting, voters must immediately leave the polling station. Voters in line at the time of closing are to be allowed to vote."

Per the Constitution, there may be more ministers (and thus ex-officio members) so long as the number of ministers does not exceed one-third of the total assembly. \n\nThe highest courts in Kuwait are the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court.

This decision was later overturned by the Sofia Administrtive Court based on an appeal brought by several politcal parties. According to Transparency International Bulgaria, although the members of the CEC are selected on the basis of expert characteristics, the principle of political commitment is the guiding principle in their selection (and in the activities of the CEC) and political biases are manifested in the making of key CEC decisions. In addition, some stakeholders expressed concerns over the limited capacity of the CEC to duly supervise the implementation of all election preparations, while the CEC acknowledged that it does not have the requisite administrative and technical capacities to effectively fullfill some of its legal responsibilities, such as printing of ballots, machine voting, and public procurement.",

However, polling commission members and security officers are allowed to vote at the polling station of their duty; students are entitled to vote in the  municipality where they study; and persons with disabilitiles may vote in any suitable polling station of their choice without submitting a prior request. Up until 14 days before election day, candidates, higher level election officials, and accredited observers can apply for a certificate to vote at any polling station within the respective constitutency. Up until 14 days before election day, any voter can request inclusion in the voter lists at the place of their current (temporary) registered residence. Secrecy of the vote is guaranteed. On arrival at the polling station, voters show their identity card, or in certain cases, their internal passport. The poll worker checks the voter's particulars against the voter register and enters the identity number and type of document shown into the voter register and admits the voter to voting. Any discrepancy in the name shown in the identification document and the voter register, if the permanent address matches, is recorded in the voter register.  If the voter is not found on the voter register he/she can be added to a supplemental list, with proof of residence in the district, and is allowed to vote upon submitting a declaration (to be attached to the voter register) that he/she has not voted and will not vote elsewhere. In polling stations with at least 300 registered voters, the voters have the option to use either paper ballot voting or direct recording electronic voting machines.  If paper voting, the voter is given a  ballot that is stamped by the poll worker with the commission's seal. The voter proceeds to the voting screen and in private marks the square of the candidate list of his/her choice and if so wishes, also marks the circle of the candidate of his/her choice. The voter folds the ballot to keep the vote secret, leaves the screen and hands the folded ballot to the poll worker who checks whether the number on the ballot matches the number on the book of ballots and if so, restamps the ballot with the seal of the commission and detaches the counterfoil and deposits it in a separate box. The voter then deposits the ballot in the ballot box, signs the voter register, and his/her identification document is given back and he/she leaves the polling site.  If the voter has spoiled the ballot, he/she can return it folded to the poll worker and a replacement ballot will be issued (only once.) In machine voting, the voter is given access to the voting device and votes by means of a magnetic card, with the device displaying a ballot identical to the paper ballot, as well as an option to vote 'against all'. After voting for the candidate list and if he/she chooses, also for a candidate on the list, he/she can change the choice once before confirming to vote. The voter receives a message that the voting is completed and the voted ballot is printed and the voter proceeds to cast the printed ballot in the same way as the paper ballots are cast. The voter then returns the magnetic card, signs the voter register, and is given back his/her identification document and leaves the polling site. The fact that the voter voted by machine is noted in the voter register. If the machine voting becomes inoperable, voting proceeds by paper ballots. Mobile (homebound) voting is available for voters with permanent disabililities, based on an advance request before polling day.

The applicant then proceeds alone to vote in secret, folds the voting paper, places it in the envelope provided, and delivers the envelope after sealing it to the Returning Officer.

An elector informs the Presiding Officer of his or her name and the constituency in which he or she proposes to vote, and the Presiding Officer, being satisfied that the person is entitled to vote and has not already voted, issues the elector one voting paper.  If so required by any scrutineer, the Presiding Officer may, before issuing any voting paper, put certain questions to the person proposing to vote, for example, whether the person is at least 18 years of age or whether he or she has already voted in the election.  In issuing a voting paper, the Presiding Officer must firmly fix a piece of gummed paper over the consecutive number on the paper in order to conceal it or to otherwise conceal the number, write his or her initials and the elector's roll number on the counter foil of the voting paper, place his or her official mark on both the counterfoil and the voting paper, and draw a line in ink through the number and name of the elector on the roll as evidence that the elector has received a voting paper. The elector is to immediately go into one of the inner compartments of the polling booth/station and while there alone (except for the case of electors in need of assisted voting), secretly vote by marking a cross (or other clear mark) in the square opposite the name of the candidate for whom he or she desires to vote.  If an elector inadvertently spoils a voting paper, he or she can return it to the Presiding Officer who will then supply the elector with a new voting paper. Before leaving the inner comparement, the elector is to fold the voting paper so that the contents cannot be seen and must then deposit it so folded in the ballot box (which is sealed or locked).   At the time of the close of the poll, electors who are present in a polling booth for the purpose of voting can cast their vote. Electors may not remain in the polling booth/station after casting a vote.  Any elector who has registered as an elector of a constitutency but whose name is not found on the roll for that constituency, or has since closing of the rolls become qualified as an elector in a constituency, or is on polling day present in a constituency other than that for which the person is registered as an elector (but has not cast an advance or postal vote) may, upon completing a declaration form, receive an ordinary voting paper and an envelope addressed to the Returning Officer marked \"Vote by Declaration\". Upon marking the voting paper in secret in an inner compartment, the elector shall place the paper, duly folded, into the envelope, and return the envelope to the Presiding Officer. After the preliminary count of the ordinary votes, the Presiding Officer is to forward the unopened envelopes with declarations to the Returning Officer who shall forward them to the Registrar of the relevant constitutency. The Registrar determines the elector's qualification or non-qualification and returns the envelopes to the Returning Officer who shall allow all qualified voting papers.

Voters who are members of the crew or passengers on board an Icelandic vessel on sailing routes abroad or on remote fishing grounds may cast their votes on board the vessel. Early voters abroad cast their votes in the offices of Icelandic embassies or permanent missions to international organisations, in consular offices or in the offices of honorary consulates, or any locations abroad, as determined in further detail by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Voters have to prove his identity, receive the prescribed electoral materials and vote using it by stamping or writing the letter of the alphabet of the list he or she wishes to vote for on the ballot paper. The voter has the right to indicate a preference regarding the order of the candidates on the list. Vote must be without assistance or without anyone seeing his vote; thereafter, he/she writes the address on the covering letter and signs it in the presence of the election official, who witnesses the casting of the vote. Voters who are unable to attend polling sessions on election day can cast their vote early (Article 56 of Act No. 24/2000). It is the voter himself who decides this. Since this is in fact interpreted broadly voters do not need an excuse to vote early. Note that the start of the early voting is eight weeks before election day and will end before the election day.

After identification, a check is printed out which the voter hands to the poll worker in exchange for a ballot. If the equipment fails to identify the voter, the voter is not allowed to vote. An official act is to be drawn up with a copy to the voter and another copy to be provided to the relevant state bodies after the official announcement of the election results for taking measures.

The voter marks the ballot in the square or in the position \"Against all\" in favour of the candidate or party of choice. If a voter spoils the ballot, a new ballot can be issued; next to the voter's name on the voter list, the poll worker notes that a replacement ballot was provided. Upon verbal notification to the polling commission, voters not able to independently vote can request assistance from another voter who is not a poll worker, candidate, partisan representative, or observer. The voter puts the marked ballot in the automated ballot box. If the automated ballot box breaks down on election day, a spare automated box is to be used and an official act drawn up.

Rule 7, schedule 4 of the Scottish Parliament (Elections etc) Order 2010 provides that postal votes must not be issued before 5pm on the 11th day before the poll.  From Electoral Commission website: http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/postalvote  You need to download, print and fill in the postal vote application form.     Once you have completed the form and made sure you have signed it, you need to send it to the Electoral Registration Office for your area.    After the deadline to become a candidate has passed (approximately three weeks before polling day), ballot papers are produced and printed. Yours will then be sent to you, in your postal voting pack.     Complete the ballot paper in line with the instructions. Make sure you do it alone and in secret.   Once you've completed your ballot paper, put it in the smaller envelope and seal it up. Next, complete and sign the postal voting statement, and put everything inside the big envelope and seal it all up.  When you're ready to return your postal vote, take it to the postbox yourself.  If you can't post it yourself, you can either ask someone you know and trust to post it for you, or you can contact your local authority to ask if they can collect it from you.  Avoid asking a candidate or party worker to post it for you.  Your postal vote needs to be with your local authority by 10pm on polling day to be counted.  If you can't post your postal vote pack in time, you can take it your polling station or to your local authority on polling day."

Absentee voting is allowed, whereby a voter can vote in a polling station in their area of temporary residence (including outside their election constituency, where they can vote for a candidate from their place of domocile), usually in a dedicated absentee polling station, based on an application submitted to the election authorites at least nine days prior to election day. Also, voters with disability can request to be transferred to an accessible polling station in their same settlement and constituency, if their regular polling station is not accessible. At a polling station, voters show an official identification card, which allows them to vote for a party list (or minority list) and show documentary proof of their address or their personal identification number, which allows them to vote for a constituency candidate.  Upon producing their identification documents and determination that the voter is on the voter list at that polling station and has not voted, the voter receives a ballot paper(s) (normally two ballots - a party/minority list ballot and a constituency ballot), to be stamped in front of the voter, and a ballot envelope, and the voter must sign the voter register (or if unable, two polling officials can sign). Voters registered as a minority voter can vote for a minority list (not a party list), and for constituency candidate. Absentee voters, even if voting outside their constituency, will be provided a ballot from the constituency of their domicile. When necessary, the polling official explains the voting process to the voter. The polling commission must advise voters to use the polling booth but cannot oblige them to do so. The voter then proceeds (to the polling booth) to mark their ballot(s).  Votes can only be cast by drawing two intersecting lines in the circle beside the name of the candidate, or above the name of the list, using a pen. The voter inserts the marked ballot(s) into the ballot envelope and inserts the envelope into the sealed ballot box. If the voter spoils the ballot paper, he or she can receive a new ballot from a polling official provided the spoiled ballot is returned before inserting it in the ballot box. Only one replacement per type of ballot can be provided. Voters with disability or who are illiterate can request a person of their choice (or two polling commission members) to assist them to fill in the ballot paper. Mobile voting can be requested by persons with limited mobility due to the health condition or disability or who are in detention, which is carried out by two members of the polling station commission. The same voting procedures apply for mobile voing; except instead of a polling booth, the voter must be provided circumstances to vote in secret. "

Applications can be submitted in person, by fax, or electronically, to reach the Parliamentary Commission within 7 days of the issue of the writ of election. A person who meets the criteria and is enrolled as an overseas voter cannot vote in the the Bahamas on polling day. Overseas voting is held in-person at certain designated polling locations (High Commissions, Consulates, and other foreign missions of the Bahamas) on the appointed advance polling date. Persons who wish to vote in the Bahamas as a special voter on the advance polling day must apply in writing to the Parliamentary Commissioner for a special voter certificate within 14 days of the issue of the writ of election.  The Parliamentary Commissioner designates the places for advance polling for special voters in the Bahamas, paying due regard to the facilities of such institutions as he or she may designate. Institutions that house certain categories of special voters, such as hospitals and nursing homes, can apply to be designated as an advance polling place for special voters.  Advance polling for eligible members of the police and defence forces is to be held at places designated by the Parliamentary Commission.  Not less than 14 days prior to the designated advance polling day, the police commissioner and defence force commodore must submit to the Parliamentary Commissioner a list of the members of the police and defence forces, respectively, which lists shall be made available for inspection by the Parliamentary Commissioner not later than 7 days before the advance polling day.  The election law provides that advance polling for all of the categories of advance voters is to be conducted in the same manner as the polling on the regular polling day in accordance with the law. At any advanced poll, a separate ballot box is provided, and at the close of such advanced poll the ballot papers in each box shall, without examination, be placed in separate packets and sealed by the presiding officer, each packet designating the number of ballot papers it contains and the relevant constituency. The sealed packets are to be immediately returned to the Parliamentary Commissioner (from both inside and outside the Bahamas) to be kept in his or her office or other safe place until delivery on the day appointed for the regular polling day to one of the presiding officers for the same constitutency to which such packet relates. Immediately before the commencement of the regular polling day, the presiding officer is to open such advance polling packets and without examining the ballot papers shall place them in the ballot box at his or her poll before he or she locks the box up and places the seal on it."

The voter is to show his or her voter's card or other sufficient means of identification. Then, if the presiding officer is satisfied that the person has not already voted and that his or her name is on the voter register for that polling division, the voter is allowed to vote.  If a voter uses an identification other than a voter's card, the presiding officer must record the voter's name and type of ID on a list. If the presiding officer is not satified with the identification of the voter or his or her right to vote because of a defective voter's card, incorrect entry in the voter register, or missing entry on the voter register for the relevant constituency or polling division, the voter is allowed to cast a \"protest vote\" using a coloured ballot paper (regular ballot papers are white).  The presiding officer gives a voter one ballot paper after the officer signs his or her own name on the back of the ballot paper, calls out the number, full name and description of the peron as stated in the register and marks the said number on the counterfoil, puts a mark against the name of that person in the register to indicate that the person has voted in that polling division,  marks the thumb of the person by dipping the thumb of his or her right hand in indelible ink or by such other officially designated mark (or otherwise left thumb, other finger, or other way to indicate the person has been issued a ballot paper), and stamps that person's voter card to indicate that the person voted in that election in that polling division. After inspecting the person's thumb or fingers with the proper equipment, the presiding officer should refuse to give a ballot paper unless satisifed that there does not appear any such mark of indelible ink. If the proper equipment is not working properly or not available, each voter must take an oath that he or she has not previously voted in that election.  A refusal to give a voter a ballot paper must be recorded with a reason by the presiding officer. Before issuing a ballot paper, the presiding officer may, and, if required so to do by a candidate or election agent, must, require any person to to take and subscribe to an oath  to confirm his or her identify and residence qualification, and that he or she has not already voted in that election. If the voter refuses to do so, the ballot cannot be issued.  Before giving the voter the ballot paper, the presiding officer must immerse the voter's thumb (finger) in the indelible ink. Upon receiving a ballot paper, the voter is to immediately go into one of the compartments to secretly vote, using the indelible pencil provided, marking one cross opposite the name of the candidate for whom he or she votes. The voter is to fold the ballot paper to conceal the vote, show the back of the paper to the presiding officer to show the officer's signature, and then drop the folded ballot paper into the ballot box. The voter must then immediately leave the polling station. A voter who inadvertently spoils a ballot paper can return it to the presiding officer and be issued a new one.

At the polling station, eligible voters must present their national ID card and are given a single paper ballot by the presiding officer if their name appears on the voter register. If the person is on the register but does not have an ID, they must still be given a ballot provided that he or she satisfies the presiding officer that they have not been issued an ID card or that it has been lost or destroyed. At the time any person applies for a ballot paper, the presiding officer may, and if required by a candidate or his or her agent, must put to that person certain questions, such as relating to identity and whether the person has already voted in that election.   Immediately before giving a person a ballot paper, the presiding officer must mark the ballot with the offiical mark, call out the name, description and roll number of the elector, mark the elector's roll number on the counterfoil, and place a mark next to the elector's roll number in the register to indicate that a ballot paper has been received. Upon receiving a ballot, the elector must proceed into one of the compartments (polling booth) and, in secret, mark the ballot by placing a cross next to their chosen candidate. The voter then folds the ballot to conceal his or her vote and must then shows the presiding officer the back of the paper so as to disclose the official mark. In the presence of the presiding officer, the voter then puts the folded ballot into a sealed ballot box.   If a voters spoils their ballot, he or she can notify the presiding officer who will issue a new ballot paper upon return of the spoiled ballot.  Upon voting, the elector must immediately leave the polling station. Where another person has voted as the elector and after satisfactorily answering the questions permitted by the law to be asked at the poll, the presiding officer is to issue the elector a \"tendered\" ballot paper. The voter does not put it in the ballot box, but gives it to the presiding officer who keeps all tendered ballots in a separate package, along with a list of electors who voted by tendered ballot.

However, the Supreme Board of Elections did not exercise oversight over the lower election boards and failed to produce manuals or voting education materials. Overall transparency in the election administration was also lacking, including the election board's failure to publish all its decisions as required by law.  Upon governors' requests based on security considerations, the election board relocated and merged a number of polling stations affecting some 120,000 voters in 16 provinces.The election board did not publish the numbers and locations of the polling stations moved, the number of voters affected, or the justification for these decisions. Some of these changes were done after the legal deadline. The measures resulted in some voters having to travel several kilometres to vote, and voters were not informed in a systematic manner of their new places for voting.  Various stakeholers noted that the affected communities opposed these measures and expressed concerns that the measures were aimed at lowering the voter turnout in areas considered to be HDP strongholds. Complaints were lodged against the decisions.",

The Overseas Electoral Register includes the records of Turkish citizens residing abroad taken from the address registration system of the General Directorate of Population and Citizenship Affairs by the General Directorate of Electoral Register.\n\nOverseas voting is implemented by several methods: in-person at foreign representations (or other designated locations), at customs gates, and by-mail. Electronic voting for overseas voters can also be implemented by decision of the Supreme Board of Elections, in which case voters are to be provided with passwords and similar safety measures are to be taken to prevent multiple voting. If electronic voting is used, it is to begin 30 days before election day and end 17:00 on election day. The Supreme Board of Elections, based on the opinion of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, determines separately or individually, the voting methods either using electronic or paper ballots, considering the type of elections and conditions of the country. The foreign representations (and other designated places) where voting will take place in-person are determined by the Supreme Board of Elections, based on the opinion Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Overseas voters may vote in the presidential election and the proportional part of the parliamentary election (not majoritarian elections.) For by-mail overseas voting, specially manufactured ballot papers and coloured voting envelopes are used, which are sent to the addresses of the overseas voters five days before the election.  One small envelope carries the seal of the foreign district election board in which the ballot is included. This envelope is to be put in another medium envelope in which the words \"foreign district election board Ankara/Turkiye\" is written and this envelope is put in a third larger envelope on which the the voters' foreign address is written. After marking the ballot paper with an 'X' beside the column of the preferred political party or presidential candidate, the voter puts the ballot paper in the small envelope and closes it. This envelope is put in the  medium envelope which is then sealed and the voter sends it in a way to arrive at the foreign district election board at the latest at 17:00 on election day. For in-person voting at polling stations located at  foreign representations (and other designated places), secrecy of the vote must be respected.  The ballots and envelopes for overseas voting in-person are specially  manufactured in special colours. When the voters comes to vote, the president of the ballot box committee checks the voters identification document and whether the voter has already voted, over a computer supported central electoral roll system. If the voter has not yet voted, he/she is given a stamped ballot paper and the 'yes' or 'preference' stamp. After voting, the voter signs on the electoral roll next to his/her name.  The sealed envelopes with the ballots are put in a bag along with the other voting materials, and sent to the overseas district election board for counting. For voting at customs gates, the period of voting begins 45 days before election day and ends 17:00 on election day; voting hours are 8:00 to 17:00. Specially manufactured ballot papers and envelopes in special colours are used for customs gate voting. The designated customs gates are determined by the Supreme Board of Elections. Secrecy of the vote must be guaranteed.  When a voter comes to a customs gate to vote, the president of the ballot box committee checks his/her identity document and that he/she has not already voted, as indicated on the computer supported central electoral roll. The voter is given a stamped ballot paper and a 'yes' or 'preference' stamp, and enters the secret voting area and completes the voting process. The voter then signs the electoral roll.  Ballots are counted at the customs gates."

The names of the above-noted persons are added at the end of the voter list by the ballot box committee. Voters who are pregnant, ill or diabled did not have to wait in line at the polling station.  One by one, the voters registered in the voter list are to prove their identity by official documents shown to the president of the ballot box committee; the list of acceptable identfication documents is  determined by the Supreme Board of Elections prior to the election day. Proxy voting is not permitted. The president finds the name fo the voter in the voter list and gives him/her one ballot paper and envelope, as well as 'yes' stamp, guides him/her to the place for secret voting if there is more than one cabin and tells the voters to go out of the cabin after folding the ballot and inserting it in the envelope. The voter must then go directly to the place for secret voting with the ballot/envelope. Nobody is allowed inside the secret voting area unless the previous voter leaves; voters who remain inside the cabin for more than a reasonable time are to be warned by the president. Voters who do not leave the area despite warning are removed from the cabin. Voters are not allowed inside the secret voting area with phones, cameras, audio or video recorders or any other communication tools. These kind of devices are to be turned off and presented to the president before voting; the devices are returned to voters after voting. The voter casts his/her vote by affixing the stamp inside the circle belonging to the political party or candidate of preference. After folding the ballot paper and placing it in the envelope and sealing it, the voter leaves the voting cabin and personally inserts the envelope inside the ballot box. The voter returns the stamp back tothe president. Voters with disabilties can be assisted by a relative registered at the polling station or by another voter. The president returns the voter's ID card to the voter and has the voter put his/her signature on the voter list. If the voter cannot sign, the fingerprint of the left thumb is taken or other finger if necessary. After voting, voters must immediately leave the polling station. Voters in line at the time of closing are to be allowed to vote."

Article 18 of the Law on Election Counselors and Members of Parliament determines that election management bodies should operate in both permanent composition (standard appointed members) and extended composition. The Parliament appoints the permanent composition of the SEC, consisting of 10 members and a president. The SEC includes four members from the parliamentary majority, four from the parliamentary opposition, one from the minority entity that received the most votes in the previous election, and one from civil society or academia. The SEC’s main responsibilities include coordinating MECs, overseeing election materials, reviewing and publishing official candidate lists, and ascertaining and publishing election results.\n\nMunicipal assemblies appoint the permanent composition of MECs, consisting of a president and four permanent members. In extended composition, the same nominating entity that submits a candidate for the presidency also nominates an individual’s membership in the extended composition. MECs determine the number and location of polling stations across the country in addition to determining the number of ballots needed for each polling station. The presidential election is administered by the SEC, 25 MECs, and approximately 1,200 PBs.",

There are three high courts: the Supreme Civil and Criminal Court, the Council of State (for cases involving the national government), and the Court of Audit. The 56 judges of the Supreme Court and the president of the Court of Audit are nominated by an expert panel called the Supreme Judicial Council and appointed by the President. The president of the Council of State is appointed by the executive cabinet. All other Council of State and Court of Audit judges are hired via a competitive process.",

If accepted, the voter is placed on the foreign voters list for a period of eight years. Overseas voters will have the right to elect only candidates who are on the parties' nationwide candidate lists and not the parliamentarians that represent a particular regional constituency.  Overseas voting will takeplace in person at polling stations which will be set up in embassies, consulates and suitable venues of Greek disaspora organizations. For an out-of-country polling station to be constituted, a minimum of 40 registered voters is required. On the day appointed for voting, voters come to the polling station of the relevant electoral division and present themselves to the electoral commitee, which determines their identity based on their Greeck police ID or Greek passport, and verifies their registration in the foreign voter list. To each voter, the electoral committee delivers an envelope initialed by the representative of the judicial authority and sealed with a stamp of the committee, a complete set of ballot forms and a blank ballot. Then the voter proceeds to the special separate area, in such a way that he/she cannot be seen, and there the voter secretly inserts the ballot paper of his choosing in the envelope given to him/her by the election committee. After securely sealing the envelope, the voter returns to the election committee and shows the envelope to the members and other attendees, to show that he/she is holding only one envelope, and then inserts the envelope into the ballot box. The election committee draws up minutes during the voting for every matter related to its conduct.\n\nThe 2023 elections will be the first time that certain out-of-country Greek citizens will be able to vote abroad.  According to legislation adopted in December 2019, after the 2019 parliamentary elections,  registered voters who are temporarily or permanently abroad must fulfil two main requirements in order to vote abroad. They must have had a two-year stay in Greece in the last 35 years and for those over 30 years old they  must have filed  a tax return in Greece in the year of the election or the preceding year."

Voters will enter the polling station one by one or in groups of small numbers in the order they arrive or in the manner laid down by each returning board. In order to be identified when proceeding to exercise their right to vote, voters have to present their ID card or their passport.

The voter is to proceed to the polling booth and must vote in secret, in such a way that he/she cannot be seen. The voter must place the chosen and marked ballot papers within the specially marked envelope and seal it, then proceed to show the sealed and stamped envelope to the chairperson of the returning board and others present, and then the voter places the envelope in the ballot box. Voters physically incapable of performing such tasks can request the court representative or a member of the returning board for obligatory assistance.  For the constituency voting, voters may select the candidate or candidates of their choice by marking the candidate's name on the party ballot.  Upon request, voters will be provided with a certificate signed by the chairperson of the returning board and bearing its stamp that he/she voted. The returning board keeps a protocol in which the electors who vote are written."

Before issuing the ballot paper(s) to a voter, the precinct election commission is obliged to check that the voter has not already voted early (e.g. by portable ballot box in remote areas) or by mobile (homebound) voting. Each voter has a right to receive two ballot papers, one for voting in the federal electoral district and one for voting in the corresponding single-mandate electoral district (except absentee voters voting outside the territory of their single-mandate electoral district receive only the ballot for the federal electoral district.) A voter who is not on the voter list for any reason can be registered on election day, upon showing a passport or other proof of residence at the polling station. Upon receipt of the ballot, the identification document number of the voter is to be entered in the voter list. The voter checks the accuracy of the entry made and both the voter and the poll worker sign the voter list in the column next to the voter's name. The voter should enter the polling booth (or other specially equipped place for secret voting) to mark the ballot. Voters should vote alone, except a voter who is unable to independently mark the ballot can request assistance of another person who is not a poll worker, partisan representative, or observer. The voter using assistance must notify the precinct election commission and the personal details of the helper are to be entered in the voter list in the column next to the voter's name. Using any mark, the voter marks the ballot for voting in the federal electoral district - in the square referring to the chosen list of candidates, and on the ballot for voting in the single mandate electoral district - in the square referring to the chosen candidate.  A voter who spoils a ballot can receive a replacement one from the poll worker, who records the issuance of a replacement ballot in the voter list next to the voter's name and signs the entry along with the secretary of the precinct election commission. The voters puts the marked ballots into the sealed ballot box. If the Central Election Commission makes a decision to use ballot envelopes, the voter is to place the marked ballots into the envelope given to him/her by the poll worker after leaving the polling booth, and places the envelope in the ballot box. Electronic voting and counting machines may be used at polling stations.   Mobile (homebound) voting is available, upon advance application, for voters who, due to health reasons, disability, caring for a person in need, or other reasons, cannot go to the polling station.

A voter who wishes to vote in at a diplomatic mission shall report to the election official at the location.  The voter is obliged to present a proof of his or her identity to the election official. Thereafter, he or she is given a ballot, a ballot envelope and a covering envelope and, if needed, a covering letter form.  The voter shall be provided with the opportunity to familiarise himself or herself with the master list of candidates for his or her electoral district. A voter in parliamentary elections has the right to vote for a candidate in the master list of candidates for the electoral district in which the voter is registered.  The voter shall mark the number of the candidate he or she is voting for in the ballot in such a manner that there can be no uncertainty as to whom he or she has voted for. The marking shall be made in the voting booth or somewhere else in a manner that maintains the election secrecy.  A person whose ability to mark the ballot is essentially weakened may request assistance from an election official, or can use the help of an assistant he or she has chosen. A candidate or his or her family member cannot assist voters. The assistant must strictly comply with the directions of the voter and keep secret the choice of the voter. The covering letter,which includes the name and identifying number of the voter, shall be addressed to the central electoral committee of that municipality and entered in the voter register next to the voter.  The voter shall sign a declaration on the covering letter stating that he or she himself or herself has, maintaining the election secrecy, filled in the ballot and enclosed it stamped in the ballot envelope. The voter shall give the folded ballot to the election official to be stamped and, immediately after the ballot is stamped, enclose it in the ballot envelope in front of the election authority. The closed ballot envelope and the signed covering letter are to be given to the election official. When a voter register is used in the advance polling station, the election official  shall check in the register that the voter has the right to vote, make an entry in the register indicating that the voter has used his or her right to vote, and make a marking on the covering letter indicating that an entry has been made in the voter register. When the voter register is not used at the polling location, a list of voters shall be kept.  The election offiical of a Finnish ship must deliver without delay the covering envelopes to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or to a Finnish diplomatic mission in the country where the ship is or where it first arrives. The election official in a Finnish diplomatic mission, or, if the mission does not serve as an advance polling station, the Head of Mission, shall ensure that the covering envelopoes that have been given there or that have arrived there are delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a manner determined by it. The Ministry shall ensure that the covering envelopes are delivered without delay to the central electoral commitee of the municipality in question."

The first possible date for postal voting is 2 March 2023, when the candidates and their candidate numbers will be confirmed. \n\nPostal voting can be used only by persons living or staying abroad for the duration of the entire advance voting period and on election day. An eligible voter wishing to vote by post shall order the postal voting documents online from the Ministry of Justice to be sent to an address abroad. The postal voting documents can be ordered three months before the election day at the earliest. An assistant may be used for placing the order. The voter's name and personal identity code and the postal address abroad to which the documents will be sent must be given with the order. The postal voting package includes a ballot, a postal ballot envelope in which the ballot is inserted, a postal vote covering letter, which the voter must fill in, a postal vote covering envelope, in which the ballot envelope and the covering letter are inserted, and postal voting instructions, drawn up by the Ministry of Justice. The eligible voter himself or herself must find out the number of the candidate that he or she wants to vote for (which are published about one month before the election day). The instructions to vote are as follows: First, the voter marks the number of the candidate he or she wants to vote for on the ballot, inserts the ballot in the postal ballot envelope, and seals the envelope. Next, the voter fills in the postal vote covering letter and signs it. Postal voters are obliged to mark the ballot and put it into the ballot envelope personally and in secret and maintaining electoral freedom. The voter must sign an attestation concerning this on the covering letter. Two witnesses must be present when the postal voting takes place. The witnesses must also sign the attestation on the covering letter stating that election secrecy has been preserved and electoral freedom respected while voting.

                "instructions": "In order to vote, a voter must be registered in the register of electors in that constituency. Employers must provide four hours paid leave for voters to go to their polling station to vote. At their designated polling station, voters are required to present a voter identification card (issued by the Electoral Commission) to a polling official who checks off the name of the voter against the voter register and issues the voter with a ballot paper. Before handing the ballot to the voter, the voter is checked that he or she does not have the black electoral ink on the right index finger. If the voter is refused a ballot due to having such ink on his or her finger, the presiding officer must make an entry in the poll book setting out the facts of the refusal.  The polling official then puts the official stamp on the ballot paper, calls out the number, name and description of the voter as stated in the voter register, and instructs the voter how to fold the ballot. A presiding officer may, and if required by a candidate or polling agent must, put to a voter at the time of applying for a ballot paper specific questions regarding the identity of the voter and whether he or she has already voted. Only if the voter satisfactorily answers the questions, if asked, can he or she be  given a ballot paper. The voter then proceeds to the polling booth to vote in secret. Electors vote by putting a cross on the ballot paper against the name of the candidate they want to represent them (any other mark or comment on the paper renders it invalid), folds the ballot so as to conceal the vote, shows the back of the folded ballot paper to the presiding officer, so as to disclose the official stamp, and then inserts the ballot paper in a sealed box in the presence of the presiding officer. Prior to inserting the ballot in the box, the presiding officer must cause the voter to immerse his or her right index finger in the black electoral ink. If the voter refuses to do so, the presiding officer takes possession of and destroys the ballot paper. A voter who spoils his or her ballot paper can return it to the presiding officer who will issue a new ballot paper if satisified that it was mistakenly spoiled.   Blind voters and those with physical disabilities may be assisted to cast their vote through a regulated procedure. A voter must vote without undue delay and leave the polling station as soon as he or she has inserted the ballot in the box. The law allows proxy voting for those unable or likely to be unable to vote in person at the polling station for reason of providing law enforcement or defence service on election day or working as an election official or polling agent on election day.  Such person wishing to vote by proxy must submit an application not later than three days before election day to be treated as an \"absent voter\" and provide the name and address of a person within the country whom he or she wishes to act as proxy to him or her. A letter 'p' will be marked beside the voter's name in the voter register and a list of proxies is made for each polling station. At the polling station, a proxy must appear on the list of proxies and show that his or her left index finger does not have red electoral ink on it (different than the black in on the right index finger for regular voters). Upon a proxy receiving the ballot paper, a mark is to be placed by his or her name in the list of proxies. Prior to placing the ballot in the ballot box, a proxy is to immerse his or her left index finger in the indelible red ink. Election officials and polling agents may, in the alternative, apply in advance to be \"transferred\" to vote at the polling station to which they are assigned, in which case they are issued a transfer certificate. If a person who appears on the voter register or on a proxy list applies for a ballot paper after another person has voted in person either as the elector or proxy, the applicant is entitled to vote a \"tendered ballot\" provided he or she satisfactorily answers questions regarding his or her identity and whether he or she has already voted. Any marked tendered ballot is separately packaged and the name and electoral number of the voter recorded."

                "instructions": "Voting is compulsory but there is no sanction for not voting.  Voters vote in person at their designated polling station (though candidates, higher level election officials, and observers can apply for a certificate to vote at any polling station within the respective constitutency). Secrecy of the vote is guaranteed. On arrival at the polling station, voters show their identity card, or in certain cases, their internal passport. The poll worker checks the voter's particulars against the voter register and enters the identity number and type of document shown into the voter register and admits the voter to voting. Any discrepancy in the name shown in the identification document and the voter register, if the permanent address matches, is recorded in the voter register.  If the voter is not found on the voter register he/she can be added to a supplemental list, with proof of residence in the district, and is allowed to vote upon submitting a declaration (to be attached to the voter register) that he/she has not voted and will not vote elsewhere. The law provides for the use of both paper ballot voting and direct recording electronic voting machines, at the voter's option. In past elections, such machines were used on  a limited basis as it was not mandatory and due to limited resources and technical expertise, but a 2020 amendment to the election law now mandates that voters have the option of either paper or machine-based voting. If paper voting, the voter is given a  ballot that is stamped by the poll worker with the commission's seal. The voter proceeds to the voting booth and in private marks the square of the candidate list of his/her choice and if so wishes, also marks the circle of the candidate of his/her choice. The voter folds the ballot to keep the vote secret, exits the booth and hands the folded ballot to the poll worker who checks whether the number on the ballot matches the number on the book of ballots and if so, restamps the ballot with the seal of the commission and detaches the counterfoil and deposits it in a separate box. The voter then deposits the ballot in the ballot box, signs the voter register, and his/her identification document is given back and he/she leaves the polling site.  If the voter has spoiled the ballot, he/she can return it folded to the poll worker and a replacement ballot will be issued (only once.) In machine voting, the voter is given access to the voting device and votes by means of a magnetic card, with the device displaying a ballot identical to the paper ballot, as well as an option to vote 'against all'. After voting for the candidate list and if he/she chooses, also for a candidate on the list, he/she can change the choice once before confirming to vote. The voter receives a message that the voting is completed and a control receipt is printed which is to be deposited in a special machine voting box.The voter then returns the magnetic card, signs the voter register, and is given back his/her identification document and leaves the polling site. The fact that the voter voted by machine is noted in the voter register. If the machine voting becomes inoperable, voting proceeds by paper ballots. Mobile (homebound) voting is available for voters with permanent disabililities, based on an advance request before polling day.  The mobile voting is carried out by not less than four poll workers on election day."

        "election_commission_historical_context": "Post Independence – 1980-2004  After independence in 1980, the new government of Zimbabwe introduced a democratic, non-racist electoral system based upon universal adult suffrage. A new electoral management structure was established consisting of the Delimitation Commission, responsible for the delimitation of electoral districts, and the Electoral Supervisory Commission (ESC), charged with supervising the conduct of elections. The management of elections was done at this stage by the Registrar-General of Elections under the supervision of the ESC. The Registrar-General registered voters and compiled voter registers, conducted the voting process and the counting and collation of votes, and announced the results of the election. The Election Directorate provided logistical support to the Registrar-General in the management of the electoral process.  2004 Restructuring  In 2004 the electoral management system was re-structured. This re-structuring was based on recommendations by the Electoral Supervisory Commission, by the political parties and by civil society organisations. The reforms also took account of the Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections adopted by the SADC Heads of State and Governments in Mauritius in 2004. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) was then established as an independent body in line with the recommendation in the SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections that elections should be run by an independent management body and not by a government department like that of the Registrar-General.  The Electoral Supervisory Commission was then abolished in 2005 by Constitutional Amendment No. 17. ZEC became the body responsible for running elections and this function was no longer performed by the Registrar-General. To reflect the new system, the title of the Registrar-General of Elections was changed to that of the Registrar-General of Voters. The function of the Registrar-General of Voters in relation to elections was now only to register voters under the supervision of ZEC. ZEC was responsible for compiling voters rolls and providing copies of these rolls to those requesting them.  The Present ZEC  ZEC was constituted in terms of Chapter 12 Section 238 of the Constitution of Zimbabwe. There are nine Commissioners, who hold office for a term of six years. There is a Chairperson and a Deputy-Chairperson both of whom are appointed on a full time basis. Four of the eight Commissioners other than the Chairperson must be women.  The Chairperson is appointed by the President after consultation with the Judicial Service Commission and the Parliamentary Committee on Standing Rules and Orders. The Chairperson must be a judge or former judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court, or a person qualified for appointment as such the other eight members are appointed by the President from a list of not fewer than twelve nominees submitted by the Parliamentary Committee on Standing Rules and Orders.  In respect of the eight Commissioners appointed under this new system, the Parliamentary Committee on Standing Rules and Orders first invites applications for these posts. It then shortlists applicants. The shortlisted applicants are subjected to a vigorous public interview process by a panel of Parliamentarians. The Constitution provisions requires that Commissioners be chosen “for their integrity and their experience and competence in the conduct of affairs in the public or private sector.”",

The Senate comprises 80 members: 60 (6 from each of the 8 provinces and the 2 cities with provincial status) elected by a party-list system of proportional representation, with men and women being listed alternately on every list; 16 traditional chiefs elected by the provincial assemblies of chiefs in the 8 provinces; 2 seats for the president and deputy president of the National Council of Chiefs (the administrative body of traditional chiefs); and 2 representatives of people with disabilities. All parliament members serve five-year terms.  The highest courts of the Zimbabwean judiciary are the Supreme Court (5 judges) and Constitutional Court (7 judges). Supreme Court judges may serve until age 70, while Constitutional Court judges serve a single 15-year term.  Judges from both courts are appointed by the President.",

[Amended by Act 11/1971] (2) The presiding officer shall instruct the voter how to make his or her mark, and shall properly fold the voter’s ballot paper, directing him or her to return it, when marked, folded as shown, but without inquiring or seeing for whom the voter intends to vote, except when the voter is unable to vote in the manner prescribed by this Act on account of illiteracy, blindness or other physical incapacity. (3) The voter, on receiving the ballot paper, shall forthwith enter one of the polling compartments in the polling station and there mark his ballot paper by marking with a black lead pencil and not otherwise a cross within the space opposite the name and symbol of the candidate for whom he or she intends to vote, and he or she shall then fold the ballot paper as directed so that the initials and the numbers on the counterfoil can be seen without opening it, and hand the paper to the presiding officer who shall, without unfolding it, ascertain by examination of the initials and the number appearing thereon that it is the same paper as that delivered to the voter and, if the same, he or she shall, subject to section 83, in full view of the voter and of all others present remove the counterfoil and deposit the ballot in the ballot box. [Amended by Act 11/1971] (4) A voter who has inadvertently so dealt with the ballot paper delivered to him or her that it cannot conveniently be used shall restore it to the presiding officer who shall cancel it by writing the word “Spoiled” across the face of the same, and the presiding officer shall then deliver another ballot paper to the voter. (5) Every voter shall vote without undue delay and shall leave the polling station as soon as his or her ballot paper has been put into the ballot box. (6) If at the closing of the poll there are any voters inside the polling station who are qualified to vote and have not been able to do so since their arrival at the polling station, the poll shall be kept open a sufficient time to enable them to vote, but no one not actually present within the polling station at the hour of closing shall be allowed to vote. [Previously section 70] 79. National identification cards and questions to be put to a voter. (1) The presiding officer at the time any person applies for a ballot paper, but not afterwards, (a) shall request that person to produce his or her national identification card; and (b) may, and if requested by a candidate or his or her agent, put to the voter the following questions: (i) are you the same person whose name appears as “A.B.” in the register of voters now in force for this polling division?; (ii) have you already voted at this election either here or elsewhere. (2) Subject to subsection (3), a ballot paper shall not be issued to any person who (a) does not produce his or her national identification card when required to do so under subsection (1)(a); and (b) does not satisfactorily answer the questions asked of him or her under subsection (1)(b). (3) A ballot paper shall be issued to any person whose name appears in the register of voters and who is unable to produce his or her national identification card, if he or she satisfies the presiding officer that (a) a national identification card has not been delivered to him or her; (b) the national identification card delivered to him or her is lost or destroyed; or (c) he or she has been duly registered to vote and his or her particulars appear on Form 3A; and that he or she is the same person whose name appears in the register of voters by producing a valid passport or other Government issued photo identification card."

The Polling Clerk checks that there is no stamp for this election on your Electoral Card. 3. The Polling Clerk looks for your name on the Electoral Roll and checks your name on both new (VES list) and old electoral roll (GVRS list). 4. When the Polling Clerk has found your name and has checked your identity, he or she will place a tick next to your name and number – make sure you are included successfully in the new Electoral Roll based on National ID registration, as this roll will be the only one to be used in future elections! 5. The Polling Clerk will give you an envelope and a booklet containing a ballot paper for each candidate. 6. Go to the Voting booth. – People with disabilities who cannot get to the polling booth or cast their ballot on their own can appoint a person to help them. This person must be a registered voter. 7. Look through the candidate booklet carefully and find the ballot paper of the person you want to vote for. You can find it easily by looking for their photo or their symbol. 8. Put the ballot paper of the candidate you want to vote for into the envelope and come out of the Voting booth. 9. Show the Polling Clerk that you have one envelope only. Throw away the left-over ballot papers in the closed bin outside the voting booths, or where the Polling Clerk tells you. 10. Put your envelope into the ballot box. 11. The polling Clerk stamps your Electoral Card with the official government stamp in the place that says “Date of Voting”. They add the date and sign. 12. Give the Polling Clerk your left thumb and get it inked. 13. Take your Electoral Card back. 14. Leave the Polling station"

Toutefois, la CENI peut, pour faciliter aux électeurs l’exercice de leur droit de vote, avancer l’heure d’ouverture ou retarder l’heure de la clôture dans certaines circonscriptions électorales.   Dans tous les cas, les opérations du vote doivent se dérouler dans un intervalle de temps de onze (11) heures précises.   Les électeurs présents devant le bureau de vote doivent voter. A cet effet, à l’heure officielle de clôture, le Président du bureau de vote fait ramasser les cartes des électeurs en commençant par le dernier de la file en attente, et seuls ceux-ci sont autorisés à voter, mention en est faite au procès-verbal.   Un arrêté du Président de la CENI précise les modalités d’application de ces dispositions.   Art. 64 (Loi n° 2019-38 du 18 juillet 2019) : Nul ne peut être admis à voter s’il ne justifie de son identité.   La carte d’électeur biométrique est l’unique document de vérification de l’identité de l’électeur.   Le vote par témoignage est interdit.

Leurs noms sont ajoutés sur la liste des électeurs votants.   Dans le cas d’espèce, l’électeur doit justifier par un récépissé de changement de résidence délivré et authentifié par la CENI locale ou la Commission administrative de son ressort.   Art. 66 : Pour les élections législatives, les candidats déclarés éligibles par la Cour constitutionnelle sont autorisés à voter dans l’un des bureaux de vote du ressort de la circonscription électorale dans laquelle ils se portent candidats sur présentation de leur carte d’électeur biométrique.

Le choix de l’électeur est libre.   Nul ne doit être influencé dans son choix par la contrainte, la menace ou la violence.   Le vote a lieu dans les bureaux désignés par la CENI.   Art. 69 : Le vote se fait au moyen d’un bulletin unique, à mettre dans l’urne par l’électeur.   Tout électeur atteint d’infirmité ou de handicap physique le mettant dans l’impossibilité d’introduire son bulletin dans l’urne est autorisé à se faire assister par un électeur de son choix ou par un membre du bureau de vote.      Art. 75 (Loi n° 2019-38 du 18 juillet 2019) : A son entrée dans le bureau de vote, l’électeur porteur de sa carte d’électeur biométrique ou de la preuve de son droit de voter par la production d’une décision du Président du Tribunal d’Instance, après avoir fait constater qu’aucune de ses mains ne porte d’empreinte et de trace d’encre indélébile, prend lui- même un bulletin unique mis à sa disposition. Le président ou un membre du bureau de vote lit à haute et intelligible voix les noms et prénoms de l’électeur qui s’apprête à voter. Celui-ci, sans quitter le bureau de vote exprime son choix. Cette opération doit se faire dans l’isoloir.   Il fait ensuite constater au président qu’il n’est porteur que d’un seul bulletin unique qu’il introduit lui-même dans l’urne.   Art. 76 : Le vote par procuration est exceptionnel ; il n’est admis qu’en cas d’incapacité physique ou d’empêchement majeur.   Sont déclarées valables les seules procurations établies par les présidents des commissions électorales locales conformément au modèle défini par la CENI.   Tout électeur mandaté pour voter par procuration doit être muni de la carte d’électeur et de la pièce d’identification de la personne qui l’a mandaté.         Le mandataire doit être inscrit dans le même bureau de vote que le mandant. Il ne peut être détenteur que d’une seule procuration.   La procuration doit être établie en deux (2) exemplaires dont l’un sera remis au mandant et l’autre classé dans les archives de la Commission locale des élections.   Elle doit être numérotée et enregistrée dans un registre spécial.   Toute procuration ne respectant pas les prescriptions du présent article est nulle.   A l’issue du dépouillement, les procurations sont jointes aux bulletins nuls, tels que prévus à l’article 88 ci-dessous et transmis à la juridiction compétente.   Art. 77 : Le vote de chaque électeur est constaté par son identification tel que prévue par l’article 75 ci-dessus, puis par sa signature ou son empreinte digitale apposée sur la liste d’émargement en face de son nom.   De plus, le vote de l’électeur est constaté par l’imprégnation de son pouce gauche à l’encre indélébile.   Tout électeur détenteur d’une procuration dûment mandatée doit procéder aux deux (2) opérations avant de passer son pouce à l’encre indélébile.       L’électeur atteint d’une infirmité le privant de son index ou de son pouce peut apposer l’empreinte de tout autre doigt sur la liste d’émargement. S’il ne dispose d’aucun doigt, la personne qui l’assiste est autorisée par le président de bureau de vote à apposer l’empreinte de son index.         Art. 78 : Dès la clôture du scrutin, la liste d’émargement est signée par tous les membres du bureau de vote.   Cette liste d’émargement est tenue à la disposition de tout électeur qui désire la consulter à la Circonscription électorale, pendant un délai de huit (8) jours à partir de la proclamation des résultats provisoires.

You can vote early either in person or by post if on election day you: •    are outside the electorate where you are enrolled to vote •    are more than 8km from a polling place •    are travelling •    are unable to leave your workplace to vote •    are seriously ill, infirm or due to give birth shortly (or caring for someone who is) •    are a patient in hospital and can't vote at the hospital •    have religious beliefs that prevent you from attending a polling place •    are in prison serving a sentence of less than three years or otherwise detained •    are a silent elector •    have a reasonable fear for your safety.  While this is technically true, it in practice is not enforced."

Members of the National Assembly are directly elected by proportional representation vote in multi-seat constituencies and serve 4-year terms. Parties and coalitions must earn at least 4% of the overall vote to receive a seat.   The high courts of Bulgaria consist of the Supreme Court of Cassation (penal, civil, and commercial legal matters), the Supreme Administrative Court (national government matters), and the Constitutional Court. Cassation and administrative judges are elected by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and confirmed by the President. These judges can serve until age 65. The Constitutional Court is independent of the judiciary branch, and its 12 justices are elected by the National Assembly and confirmed by the President and SJC. Constitutional Court justices serve 9-year terms, and one-third of justices are replaced every 3 years.",

Members of the National Assembly are directly elected by proportional representation vote in multi-seat constituencies and serve 4-year terms. Parties and coalitions must earn at least 4% of the overall vote to receive a seat.   The high courts of Bulgaria consist of the Supreme Court of Cassation (penal, civil, and commercial legal matters), the Supreme Administrative Court (national government matters), and the Constitutional Court. Cassation and administrative judges are elected by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and confirmed by the President. These judges can serve until age 65. The Constitutional Court is independent of the judiciary branch, and its 12 justices are elected by the National Assembly and confirmed by the President and SJC. Constitutional Court justices serve 9-year terms, and one-third of justices are replaced every 3 years.",

                "instructions": "Voting is compulsory but there is no sanction for not voting.  Voters vote in person at their designated polling station (though candidates, higher level election officials, and observers can apply for a certificate to vote at any polling station within the respective constitutency). Secrecy of the vote is guaranteed. On arrival at the polling station, voters show their identity card, or in certain cases, their internal passport. The poll worker checks the voter's particulars against the voter register and enters the identity number and type of document shown into the voter register and admits the voter to voting. Any discrepancy in the name shown in the identification document and the voter register, if the permanent address matches, is recorded in the voter register.  If the voter is not found on the voter register he/she can be added to a supplemental list, with proof of residence in the district, and is allowed to vote upon submitting a declaration (to be attached to the voter register) that he/she has not voted and will not vote elsewhere. The law provides for the use of both paper ballot voting and direct recording electronic voting machines, at the voter's option. In past elections, such machines were used on  a limited basis as it was not mandatory and due to limited resources and technical expertise, but a 2020 amendment to the election law now mandates that voters have the option of either paper or machine-based voting. If paper voting, the voter is given a  ballot that is stamped by the poll worker with the commission's seal. The voter proceeds to the voting booth and in private marks the square of the candidate of his/her choice. The voter folds the ballot to keep the vote secret, exits the booth and hands the folded ballot to the poll worker who checks whether the number on the ballot matches the number on the book of ballots and if so, restamps the ballot with the seal of the commission and detaches the counterfoil and deposits it in a separate box. The voter then deposits the ballot in the ballot box, signs the voter register, and his/her identification document is given back and he/she leaves the polling site.  If the voter has spoiled the ballot, he/she can return it folded to the poll worker and a replacement ballot will be issued (only once.) In machine voting, the voter is given access to the voting device and votes by means of a magnetic card, with the device displaying a ballot identical to the paper ballot, as well as an option to vote 'against all'. After voting for the candidate list, he/she can change the choice once before confirming to vote. The voter receives a message that the voting is completed and a control receipt is printed which is to be deposited in a special machine voting box.The voter then returns the magnetic card, signs the voter register, and is given back his/her identification document and leaves the polling site. The fact that the voter voted by machine is noted in the voter register. If the machine voting becomes inoperable, voting proceeds by paper ballots. Mobile (homebound) voting is available for voters with permanent disabililities, based on an advance request before polling day.  The mobile voting is carried out by not less than four poll workers on election day."

Parties, candidates, observers and media can observe the mobile voting process. A special list of mobile voters is posted outside the polling station two days earlier. The home-bound voter must identify him/herself to the poll workers on the basis of biometric and personal data. Upon identification, the ballot is issued to the voter (no check issued) and the poll worker registers the voter in the paper voter list by putting the series and number of the voter's ID and signs it. The voter signs the voter list upon verification of the entries.  The voter marks the ballot in a special place that allows secrecy of the vote, as well as observation by poll workers and observers. A voter who is unable to fill out the ballot on his/her own due to disability or health condition can request assistance of another voter (but not poll worker, partisan representatives or observers.)

A voter's identity is checked at the polling station based on his/her biometric and personal data using identification equipment at the polling station. Voter consent is not required. The voter's information is shown on a monitor, visible to partisan representatives and observers. After identification, a check is printed out which the voter hands to the poll worker in exchange for a ballot. If the equipment fails to identify the voter, the voter is not allowed to vote. An official act is to be drawn up with a copy to the voter and another copy to be provided to the relevant state bodies after the official announcement of the election results for taking measures. A ballot is issued to the voter upon presentation of an identity document. When a ballot is issued to a voter, the poll worker registers the voter in the paper voter list, by entering the series and number of the voter's ID and signing the voter list. The voter signs the voter list upon checking the accuracy of the entries. The voter marks the ballot in secret in the voting booth or other specially equipped place. The voter marks the ballot in the square or in the position \"Against all\" in favour of the candidate or party of choice. If a voter spoils the ballot, a new ballot can be issued; next to the voter's name on the voter list, the poll worker notes that a replacement ballot was provided. Upon verbal notification to the polling commission, voters not able to independently vote can request assistance from another voter who is not a poll worker, candidate, partisan representative, or observer. The voter puts the marked ballot in the automated ballot box. If the automated ballot box breaks down on election day, a spare automated box is to be used and an official act drawn up. If the spare automated ballot box is damaged, voting is to be carried out using a stationary ballot box, and an official act drawn up. If the automated ballot box is repaired it cannot, in any case, be used."

It is comprised of three administrative divisons: Republika Srpska (primarily Serb), the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (primarily Bosniak and Croat), and the Brcko District (primarily ethnically mixed). Each of the primary ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Serbs, Bosnians, and Croats) elect a president for a 4-year term. Each of these presidents serves on a rotating basis as the Chairman of the Presidency, with rotations every 8 months. \n\nBiH has a bicameral national parliament (called the Assembly) that consists of the House of Peoples and the House of Representatives. The House of Peoples has 15 seats, with each of the three main ethnic groups alotted 5 seats each. Members of the House of Peoples are designated by regional parliaments in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska respectively. The House of Representatives is comprised of 42 total seats, which are split between members from Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \n\nNotably, both major entities in BiH have their own regional parliamentary systems. In Republika Srpska, there is a unicameral National Assembly with 83 seats. In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, there is a bicameral parliament with a total of approximately 180 seats split between the two houses. The Brcko District also has its own governance structure, but does not directly feed into the National Assembly in the same way. \n\nThe judiciary in Bosnia and Herzegovina is comprised of the Constitutional Court and the Court of BiH, as well as a variety of cantonal and municipal courts. Members of the Constitutional Court are selected by the President of the European Court of Human Rights in consultation with the tripartite presidency. Note that Republika Srpska has begun the process of splitting away from the jurisdiction of the broader judiciary in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ",

Proxy voting is not allowed. Once the voter is identified, the polling official marks the voter's name in the voter register, the voter signs the voter register next to his or her name (must correspond to signature on ID), and a ballot is issued to the voter. Voters who are not found on the voter list on election day and can present a valid identification card and proof of residence are allowed to vote. \n\nTo cast their vote, the voter proceeds to the polling booth to vote in secret. The voter can choose one of the following options on the ballot: (1) an independent candidate, if any; (2) a political party, coalition or list of independent candidates; or (3) within one list of candidates, mark one or more candidates on the one list chosen by the voter. If the voter spoils his or her ballot, a new ballot can be obtained upon returning the spoiled ballot to the polling station committee. Upon marking the ballot, the voter proceeds to insert it into the sealed ballot box.\n\nA blind, illiterate or bodily incapacitated person can request from the president of the polling station committee to allow another person selected by the voter to assist him or her to sign the voter register and cast his or her ballot. The helper cannot be a polling official or election observer, and can help only one voter; the helper must sign the voter register next to the name of the voter he or she assisted. Homebound voters and those voters confined in places of detention can vote via mobile ballot boxes.\n\nSource: 2001 Election Law Articles 1.4 (2), 3.9 (1-4), 3.16 (6), 3.17 (1-3), 5.1 (1), 5.8 (1), 5.8, 5.10, 5.11 (1-2), 5.12 (1-5), 5.13(1-2), 5.14 (1-3), 5.18 (1-2), 5.19 (1-4), 5.20, 5.21 (2)"

It is comprised of three administrative divisons: Republika Srpska (primarily Serb), the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (primarily Bosniak and Croat), and the Brcko District (primarily ethnically mixed). Each of the primary ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Serbs, Bosnians, and Croats) elect a president for a 4-year term. Each of these presidents serves on a rotating basis as the Chairman of the Presidency, with rotations every 8 months. \n\nBiH has a bicameral national parliament (called the Assembly) that consists of the House of Peoples and the House of Representatives. The House of Peoples has 15 seats, with each of the three main ethnic groups alotted 5 seats each. Members of the House of Peoples are designated by regional parliaments in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska respectively. The House of Representatives is comprised of 42 total seats, which are split between members from Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \n\nNotably, both major entities in BiH have their own regional parliamentary systems. In Republika Srpska, there is a unicameral National Assembly with 83 seats. In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, there is a bicameral parliament with a total of approximately 180 seats split between the two houses. The Brcko District also has its own governance structure, but does not directly feed into the National Assembly in the same way. \n\nThe judiciary in Bosnia and Herzegovina is comprised of the Constitutional Court and the Court of BiH, as well as a variety of cantonal and municipal courts. Members of the Constitutional Court are selected by the President of the European Court of Human Rights in consultation with the tripartite presidency. Note that Republika Srpska has begun the process of splitting away from the jurisdiction of the broader judiciary in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ",

                "instructions": "Voters normally vote at the polling station at which they are recorded on the voter register, which is their place of permanent residence (internally displaced persons may vote in their area of displacement if they so choose).                                            Internally displaced persons have the right to either vote in the polling station of their temporary residence, provided such residence has been kept for at least six months, or in special \"absentee\" polling stations for the electoral unit where they were registered before being displaced.   The polling official determines the identity of the voter on the basis of one of three types of valid identification documents. Proxy voting is not allowed. Once the voter is identified, the polling official marks the voter's name in the voter register, the voter signs the voter register next to his or her name (must correspond to signature on ID), and a ballot is issued to the voter. Voters who are not found on the voter list on election day and  can present a valid identification card and proof of residence are allowed to vote.   To cast their vote, the voter proceeds to the polling booth to vote in secret. The voter marks their one preferred candidate on the ballot. If the voter spoils his or her ballot, a new ballot can be obtained upon returning the spoiled ballot to the polling station committee. Upon marking the ballot, the voter proceeds to insert it into the sealed ballot box.  A person registered as an out-of-country voter who has returned from abroad and wants to vote in-person in the country is entitled to vote by 'tendered' ballot. Tendered ballots are put by the voter into a sealed envelope bearing the voters identification information (which is then inserted into the ballox box) and later counted only after the envelope is forwarded to the central election body and the voter's information is checked against the central voter register.  A blind, illiterate or bodily incapacitated person can request from the president of the polling station committee to allow another person selected by the voter to assist him or her to sign the voter register and cast his or her ballot. The helper cannot be a polling official or election observer, and can help only one voter; the helper must sign the voter register next to the name of the voter he or she assisted.  Homebound voters and those voters confined in places of detention can vote via mobile ballot boxes.

        "election_commission_historical_context": "The Autonomous National Electoral Commission (CENA) is a Beninese administrative body responsible for organizing and supervising elections in Benin.  It was created in 1995 to concretize and strengthen the democratic process initiated in Benin since the National Conference of Vital Forces of February 1990, which opened the way to democratic rule.  The very first presidential and legislative elections in 1991 were organized by the Ministry of the Interior, while all others were organized by this non-permanent commission before the 2013 electoral code.  The autonomous national electoral commission has undergone a number of changes in accordance with the electoral laws governing each election.1  In 1990, Benin, after adopting a democratic system following the national conference, undertook reforms to ensure the performance and transparency of the electoral system.  With the end of the era of monolithism imposed by the 1977 Fundamental Law, the election ceased to be a mere formality, a ritual of legitimization and ratification of the choices made by the single party and the National Revolutionary Assembly (NRA), which led to some contestation of the administration [unclear] 2.  The neutrality recognized in the administration was contested, and serious doubts about its ability to organize honest elections gained prominence as a result of the euphoria over the success of the National Conference. The Ministry of the Interior retained its prerogatives with regard to the organization of elections just for the 1990 constituent referendum and the 1991 presidential and legislative elections, assisted by the National Committee in charge of monitoring elections, created by ministerial order No. 130/MISAT/MDN/MF/DC/SA of October 23, 1990. The committee's mission is to monitor the material organization of the referendum and electoral consultations during the transition period, ensure strict compliance with the texts in force, and coordinate the actions of the various ministerial departments involved in organizing the referendum and electoral operations.  After the 1991 elections, there were two antagonistic blocs: the movement organized around the Head of the Executive and the opposition, which controlled the office of the Parliament. On the eve of the 1995 legislative elections, a climate of suspicion and doubt was expressed by the opposition about the ability of the Ministry of the Interior to organize an electoral competition, despite its experience in organizing the 1991 presidential elections and the 1991 legislative elections without major disputes.2  In 1993, the opposition, united in the National Convention of the Forces of Change, petitioned the President of the Republic for the creation of an Independent Electoral Commission, the only guarantee of truly transparent elections. Supported by civil society organizations, despite the disapproval of President Nicephore Soglo, the then Head of State, for the creation of this independent commission, the opposition succeeded in introducing and passing the law creating the Autonomous National Electoral Commission (CENA) in the National Assembly on September 15, 1994, the day before the 1995 legislative elections.  The Head of State's appeal for unconstitutionality dated November 30, 1994 did not succeed in the Constitutional Court, which ruled in favor of the Parliament2.  The promulgation of law N° 94-013 of January 17, 1995, on the general rules for the elections of the President of the Republic and the members of the National Assembly, put an end to all suspicions of electoral fraud in Benin. Law N° 94-014 of January 27, 1995 on the electoral code in the Republic of Benin institutes ANEC and Law N° 94-015 of January 27, 1995 defines its mode of operation   ",

An INEC official will check if you are at the correct polling unit and confirm that the PVC presented belongs to you.  Step 2:  An INEC official will confirm if your PVC is genuine using the card reader. You will be asked to place your finger on the card reader.  Step 3:  An INEC official will ask for your PVC and confirm you are listed in the Voters Register. Your name will be ticked and your finger will be inked to confirm you have voted. If your name is not found you cannot vote.  Step 4:  The Presiding officer will stamp, sign and endorse your ballot paper. You will be given the ballot paper rolled with the printed side inwards and directed to the voting cubicle.  Step 5:  Stain your finger with the ink given and mark the box for your preferred candidate/party. Roll the ballot paper in the manner you were given and flatten it.  Step 6:  Leave the voting cubicle and drop the ballot paper in the ballot box in full view of people at the Polling Unit.  Step 7:  Leave the Polling Unit or wait if you so choose, in an orderly and peaceful manner, to watch the process up to declaration of result.  N.B: The result of each Polling Unit shall be pasted at the unit for everyone to see.  Your right as a voter:  On each Election Day, you have the right to:  Access the polling station Receive information on the voting procedures from the poll officials Vote in secret.

The SEC and MECs are permanent bodies that serve four-year terms, and MECs manage the appointment of the PBs for each election. Article 18 of the Law on Election Counselors and Members of Parliament determines that election management bodies should operate in both permanent composition (standard appointed members) and extended composition. The Parliament appoints the permanent composition of the SEC, consisting of 10 members and a president. The SEC includes four members from the parliamentary majority, four from the parliamentary opposition, one from the minority entity that received the most votes in the previous election, and one from civil society or academia. The SEC’s main responsibilities include coordinating MECs, overseeing election materials, reviewing and publishing official candidate lists, and ascertaining and publishing election results.  Municipal assemblies appoint the permanent composition of MECs, consisting of a president and four permanent members. In extended composition, the same nominating entity that submits a candidate for the presidency also nominates an individual’s membership in the extended composition. MECs determine the number and location of polling stations across the country in addition to determining the number of ballots needed for each polling station. The presidential election is administered by the SEC, 25 MECs, and approximately 1,200 PBs.",

However, a voter can apply with the local electoral commission up to three days before election day for absentee voting if they will not be at their district of registered permanent residence on election day, including voters who permanently reside abroad and are to be in Slovenia on election day. Absentee voting allows a voter to vote outside the regular polling station where he or she has permanent residence, at a designated polling station without territorial jurisdiction.  Hungarian and Italian national community voters residing outside of their bilingual municipalities have the opportunity to vote for their respective deputy in their place of residence anywhere in Slovenia and abroad.  At the polling station, voters give their name and surname (and if necessary their address) and the election committee official will determine the voter's identity using any personal identification document that shows the voter's personal data, or in some other manner. Proxy voting is not allowed. The electoral official then circles the serial number before the name on the voter register and the voter signs next to his or her name. The ballot paper(s) is then handed to the voter. Voters are entitled to one ballot, except members of the Italian and Hungarian national communities (which each have one deputy in the parliament) are entitled to a regular ballot and a ballot to vote for their respective ethnic miniority deputy, provided that the person is registered as a minority voter.  If requested by the voter, the election official must explain the technical aspects of the voting. If by mistake, a voter is not entered on the voter register, he or she may vote on the basis of a certificate issued by the competent body stating that he or she is enrolled as a voter in the area of that polling station. If the name of a person who wishes to vote has already been circled on the voter register and there is a signature next to the name, or if there is a note that the person is registered to vote by another method, this fact should be entered in the records, but the voter will not be allowed to vote.  Once issued the ballot(s), voters proceed to vote in secret in the polling booth as follows: (1) for the general ballot, the voter shall vote by circling the serial number before the name of the (one) candidate for whom he or she wishes to vote and (2) for the Hungarian and Italian national community ballot, the minority voter shall vote by circling the serial number before the name of the (one) candidate for whom he or she wishes to vote. The voter then proceeds to insert the ballot(s) in the ballot box.  Persons with disabilities can be assisted in voting by a person of their choice. Voters who are disabled or illiterate and not able to vote independently, can be assisted by a person of their choice to complete and cast the ballot paper(s).  Mobile voting is available for ill (and disabled?) voters who cannot vote in person at the polling station where they are registered to vote, whereby the election committee visits their home to facilitate their voting. Applications for mobile voting must be made no later than three days before polling day.  Source: 1992 National Assembly Elections Act Articles 7-9, 71-75, 79a"

You can vote early either in person or by post if on election day you: •    are outside the electorate where you are enrolled to vote •    are more than 8km from a polling place •    are travelling •    are unable to leave your workplace to vote •    are seriously ill, infirm or due to give birth shortly (or caring for someone who is) •    are a patient in hospital and can't vote at the hospital •    have religious beliefs that prevent you from attending a polling place •    are in prison serving a sentence of less than three years or otherwise detained •    are a silent elector •    have a reasonable fear for your safety.  While this is technically true, it in practice is not enforced."

The Tribunal is in charge of convening the National Constituent Assembly, which drafted the current Political Constitution of the Republic and formalized the creation of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.\n\nAccording to the new Political Constitution of the Republic, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal was created to be responsible for regulating everything related to the exercise of citizens' rights: political organizations, the exercise of political rights and the organization and operation of the electoral authorities.\n\nFrom its creation to date, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal is responsible for the organization of 20 electoral processes, all of them satisfactorily, because it has guaranteed the respect for the Constitution, the Electoral and Political Parties Law, and the will of the people.\n\nhttps://tse.org.gt/index.php/homepage/historia",

Some stakeholders expressed concerns about the capacity of some municipalities to properly manage postal voting and the transparency of the process at the Ministry of Interior, which oversees the postal voting process, due to the lack of clearly stipulated procedures on the handling of ballots and the lack of information on practical arrangements put into place. Some stakeholders pointed out the lack of information campaigns on postal voting by the election administration. Public calls were made for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to consider providing technical assitance and faciilating voter information abroad. In November 2022, amendments to the election law elaborate on the procedures for oversesas postal voting which will take effect for the 2023 election.",

        "election_commission_historical_context": "In the Argentine Republic the knowledge of electoral matters has been entrusted to the Judiciary of the Nation.  Prior to the creation of the National Electoral Chamber in 1962, Decree 11.976/45 was issued during the de facto government, which approved the \"Organic Statute of the Political Parties and established the creation of the \"Federal Electoral Court\".  However, the referred Statute was repealed and the Federal Electoral Court -whose members had resigned in full two days before- was dissolved. In 1962, by decree 7.163/62 the National Electoral Chamber was created.  This regulation placed special emphasis on the \"convenience of having a specialized court in charge of resolving the issues arising from the application of the electoral and political parties laws\".  Thus, and even with some differences with the current regime, the National Electoral Chamber was created. At that time, the Court was composed of five judges and an attorney general, and its presidency was permanent.  The following year, it was established -by decree-law 6.407/63- that the National Electoral Justice \"would integrate the Judicial Power of the Nation, as a court specialized in legal-political and electoral matters\".  It was also established that the National Electoral Chamber would act as \"court of appeal with respect to the national electoral judges\".  The creation of the electoral jurisdiction was later ratified by law 16.478 -which provided that the decrees issued with force of law by the de facto government, between March 29, 1962 and October 12, 1963, would continue to be in force- and, fundamentally, through the sanction of law 16.652.  This 1964 law provided for the intervention of the National Electoral Justice in all matters relating to the organization, recognition, operation and expiration of political parties, as well as in all contentious issues arising from the application of such law.  It should be recalled that by virtue of the coup d'état of June 28, 1966, the dissolution of the political parties was decreed. Months later, Law 17.014 was enacted, which determined the legal suppression of the National Electoral Chamber.  The magistrates of the National Electoral Chamber became judges of the National Chamber of Appeals for Peace and the National Chamber of Appeals for Economic Criminal Matters.  The electoral secretariats changed their name to \"Registries of Enrollment Records\" and the then National Registry of Enrollment as well as the Registry of Letters of Citizenship were in charge of the National Court of First Instance in Federal Criminal and Correctional Matters No. 1 of the Federal Capital. In 1971, Law 19,108 was enacted to create an \"Electoral Chamber\" within the National Court of Appeals in Federal and Contentious-Administrative Matters of the Federal Capital.  Subsequently, by virtue of the enactment of Law 19.277, and prior to the appointment of its members, the \"Electoral Chamber\" was transformed into the National Electoral Chamber, with its current structure of three judges forming a single chamber.

In the Chamber of Deputies, all 257 members are directly elected by party-list proportional representation vote from multi-seat constituencies.

        "election_commission_historical_context": "In the Argentine Republic the knowledge of electoral matters has been entrusted to the Judiciary of the Nation.  Prior to the creation of the National Electoral Chamber in 1962, Decree 11.976/45 was issued during the de facto government, which approved the \"Organic Statute of the Political Parties and established the creation of the \"Federal Electoral Court\".  However, the referred Statute was repealed and the Federal Electoral Court -whose members had resigned in full two days before- was dissolved. In 1962, by decree 7.163/62 the National Electoral Chamber was created.  This regulation placed special emphasis on the \"convenience of having a specialized court in charge of resolving the issues arising from the application of the electoral and political parties laws\".  Thus, and even with some differences with the current regime, the National Electoral Chamber was created. At that time, the Court was composed of five judges and an attorney general, and its presidency was permanent.  The following year, it was established -by decree-law 6.407/63- that the National Electoral Justice \"would integrate the Judicial Power of the Nation, as a court specialized in legal-political and electoral matters\".  It was also established that the National Electoral Chamber would act as \"court of appeal with respect to the national electoral judges\".  The creation of the electoral jurisdiction was later ratified by law 16.478 -which provided that the decrees issued with force of law by the de facto government, between March 29, 1962 and October 12, 1963, would continue to be in force- and, fundamentally, through the sanction of law 16.652.  This 1964 law provided for the intervention of the National Electoral Justice in all matters relating to the organization, recognition, operation and expiration of political parties, as well as in all contentious issues arising from the application of such law.  It should be recalled that by virtue of the coup d'état of June 28, 1966, the dissolution of the political parties was decreed. Months later, Law 17.014 was enacted, which determined the legal suppression of the National Electoral Chamber.  The magistrates of the National Electoral Chamber became judges of the National Chamber of Appeals for Peace and the National Chamber of Appeals for Economic Criminal Matters.  The electoral secretariats changed their name to \"Registries of Enrollment Records\" and the then National Registry of Enrollment as well as the Registry of Letters of Citizenship were in charge of the National Court of First Instance in Federal Criminal and Correctional Matters No. 1 of the Federal Capital. In 1971, Law 19,108 was enacted to create an \"Electoral Chamber\" within the National Court of Appeals in Federal and Contentious-Administrative Matters of the Federal Capital.  Subsequently, by virtue of the enactment of Law 19.277, and prior to the appointment of its members, the \"Electoral Chamber\" was transformed into the National Electoral Chamber, with its current structure of three judges forming a single chamber.",

A voter casts a ballot in the polling station in the  constituency where he/she is on the voter register (or at any polling station in the constituency where the polling card was issued). Proxy voting is not permitted. Measures must be taken to ensure that the voter can cast the vote and fold the ballot paper without being observed, either a voting booth or room adjoining the main room.  Upon entering the polling station, the voter is given an official ballot paper and may be requested to show his/her voter notice.  In the voting booth, the voter casts the two votes by twice marking the ballot with a cross or other sign to clearly indicate the candidate and party list of choice. The two votes are cast on one ballot that has two parts - one part for the constituency candidate and one part for the party list. The voter then folds the ballot paper to ensure the secrecy of the vote, and approaches the table of the electoral board and hands over his/her voter's notice and identification document ( identification document is not strictly required, unless the voter does not have a voter's notice or if the poll worker otherwise requests). If the voter's notice or identification document is not presented the voter is not allowed to cast the ballot. The poll worker checks the voter's information against the voter register and if present and not marked as voted, marks in the voter register that the voter has voted and allows the voter to proceed to put the ballot in the locked ballot box. If the voter is not in the voter register (or does not produce a polling card if present in the polling register as having received a postal voting package), he/she is not allowed to vote. Other grounds for refusing the voter to cast the ballot is if the voter marked or folded the ballot outside the booth or otherwise jeoparidized the secrecy of the vote. If a voters spoils her/his ballot, another ballot can be requested provided that the voter  destroys the spoiiled ballot in the presence of a poll worker. Voting machines can be used instead of ballot papers and ballot boxes to facilitate the casting and counting of votes.  A voter who is illiterate or has a disability can request a person to assist provided the person does not have a conflict of interest. The person assisting is bound to mark the ballot according to the intent of the voter and must keep the ballot choice secret.   Only voters who arrive before the end of polling hours and are inside the polling station or in front of it due to lack of space shall be permitted to cast their votes."

The overseas voter register is permanent, so that voters do not need to register anew for each election. Registered out-of-country electors may also designate a proxy upon application to the mayor of The Hague at least six weeks before the polling day. Registered postal voter receive a postal vote certificate (not a voting pass) as proof of being allowed to vote by post. The postal voting packages are mailed out to out-of-country voters. Postal voters have the option of downloading their postal ballot electronically but must mark and cast the ballots in hard copy. To allow for voters to print the ballot themselves, in past elections the postal ballot was much smaller than the in-person ballot, with numbers for places on the list but not all the candidates' names. The postal voting package includes the ballot, the ballot envelope, the return envelope with the pre-printed return address, a postal vote certificate containing a declaration to be signed by the person that he or she has personally completed the ballot paper, and voting instructions. In the return envelope, voters send back the ballot in the ballot envelope, as well as signed postal vote certificate, which they received separately. The postal voter colours the white spot in front of the name/number of the candidate of her or his choice, in red, blue or black. The ballot is then folded and put in the ballot envelope. The voter then signs the postal vote certificate declaring that he or she has completed the ballot paper personally. The voter encloses a copy of an approved identity document, which must be valid.  The postal ballot certificate, copy of ID, and envelope containing the ballot paper are then placed in the accompanying return envelope which is closed and returned (with adequate stamps). The postal ballots can be mailed to The Hague municipality or dropped off at a designated Dutch diplomatic or consular mission or other overseas location serving as a collection point for votes abroad, Dutch representations at the Carribean countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, or collection points designated by the Ministry of Defence at military missions outside The Netherlands. The votes handed in to these collection points are counted at the collection points and the results transmitted electronically to The Hague district election committee. The oveseas ballots are counted by the The Hague district election committee and count in the results of The Hague municipality."

This invitation includes the voter's poll card (voting pass) which allows the voter to cast their vote in the polling station of their choice within the borders of the municipality in which he or she is registered. The poll card (voting pass) is a personalized document with security features against copying. Voters can request a replacement in case of loss, including on election day. Voters may also request, by written or oral application to the  municipality where he or she is registered, to vote at any other location in the country, in which case they are issued a voter's (absentee) pass. Such requests in writing must be received no later than five days before polling day or in case of oral request, by 12 noon on the day before voting.  Municipal authorities can set up mobile polling stations that move from designated location to designated location on election day during certain times. Any voter unable to cast their vote in person on election day, including voters residing abroad, may appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf. No justification is required to request a proxy vote, but voters cannot request a proxy in a polling station. Appointing a proxy may be done by simply providing the chosen proxy who resides in the same municipality with a signed voting pass or voter's (absentee) pass. A proxy residing outside the voter's municipality may be authorized through an application to the mayor received no later than five days before the polling day, in which case a certificate of authorization is issued to the proxy. A proxy may cast the additional vote in a polling station only together with her or his vote, upon presentation of the signed voting or voter's pass and (copy of) the identification document of the represented person. One person can be the proxy of only up to two persons. Prisoners can only vote by proxy. All voters casting votes must show an authorized identification document to the poll worker. Any such identification may not have expired by more than five years. The voter must also hand in his/her poll card (voting pass) or voter's (absentee) pass to the poll worker before voting. Upon doing so, the poll worker checks that the voting pass has not been invalidated (according to the list of invalid passes) and that it corresponds to the identity document. If the pass is not on the invalid list and the pass and identification correspond then the voter is issued a ballot paper and the poll worker directs the voter  to the polling booth. The poll worker retains and cancels the voting pass. Proxy voters who have a certificate of authorization are to hand it over to the poll worker. Polling stations do not keep voters lists (the retention of voting passes prevents multiple voting.) The polling booths must have instructions on voting, established by ministerial order. Voters are required to mark the ballot in secret in the polling booth with a red pencil.  In each electoral district, votes are cast for the candidates whose names appear on the lists of candidates for that electoral district. Voters can vote for a list or have the option to cast a preferential vote for a candidate of choice.  The voter colours in the white spot opposite the name of the candidate of her or his choice. The voter then folds the ballot paper, leaves the polling booth, and inserts the ballot in the ballot box next to the electoral committee's table. If the voter does not put the ballot in the box, the chairperson shall make a note of it. If a voter makes a mistake when completing the ballot paper, he or she can return it to the chairperson and, on request, will be provided (once) with a new ballot paper. The law provides that if a voter requires help because of her or his physical condition, the electoral committee should allow him or her to avail themself of assistance.  Voters are allowed to remain in the polling station while the electoral committee is in session, provided they do not create a disturbance or hinder the progress of the session."

The law does not impose expenditure ceilings related to campaign on either parties or candidates.&nbsp; Parties must record all contributions over EUR 1,000, both monetary and in-kind. A few weeks prior to each election, participating political parties and candidates must disclose to the Ministry of Interior the donors for their contributions of over EUR 4,500 in recent years and parties must disclose their recent loans of over EUR 25,000 in a calendar year. The law requires that these reports be made public seven days before an election.&nbsp; Parliamentary parties must submit their annual financial reports certified by an auditor by 1 July (for the previous year) to the Ministry of Interior. The Ministry of Interior publishes the reports in the Government Gazette and on its website, although the law does not provide a deadline for publishing. There are no requirements for reporting on campaign expenditures before or after an election, other than in the party's annual party finance reports.&nbsp; The Ministry of Interior, with the assistance of an advisory body - the Commission on Politcal Party Finance - oversees political and campaign finance. The Commission consists of three members appointed by the Ministry of Interior for up to two four-year terms, none of whom represent the governing bodies. The Commission meets once a year and upon request by the Ministry of Interior provides opinion on issues related to political finance. The Commission reviews the parties' annual reports and the electoral contestants' financial reports and advises the Ministry of Interior on their compliance with the law.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of infringements of political finance rules, the Ministry of Interior, under the advice of the Commission, can impose a range of administrative fines, up to EUR 25,000 for not keeping records on contributions and loans, receiving anonymous donations over EUR 1,000, or not submitting the required reports.

        "election_commission_historical_context": "Post Independence – 1980-2004  After independence in 1980, the new government of Zimbabwe introduced a democratic, non-racist electoral system based upon universal adult suffrage. A new electoral management structure was established consisting of the Delimitation Commission, responsible for the delimitation of electoral districts, and the Electoral Supervisory Commission (ESC), charged with supervising the conduct of elections. The management of elections was done at this stage by the Registrar-General of Elections under the supervision of the ESC. The Registrar-General registered voters and compiled voter registers, conducted the voting process and the counting and collation of votes, and announced the results of the election. The Election Directorate provided logistical support to the Registrar-General in the management of the electoral process.  2004 Restructuring  In 2004 the electoral management system was re-structured. This re-structuring was based on recommendations by the Electoral Supervisory Commission, by the political parties and by civil society organisations. The reforms also took account of the Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections adopted by the SADC Heads of State and Governments in Mauritius in 2004. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) was then established as an independent body in line with the recommendation in the SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections that elections should be run by an independent management body and not by a government department like that of the Registrar-General.  The Electoral Supervisory Commission was then abolished in 2005 by Constitutional Amendment No. 17. ZEC became the body responsible for running elections and this function was no longer performed by the Registrar-General. To reflect the new system, the title of the Registrar-General of Elections was changed to that of the Registrar-General of Voters. The function of the Registrar-General of Voters in relation to elections was now only to register voters under the supervision of ZEC. ZEC was responsible for compiling voters rolls and providing copies of these rolls to those requesting them.  The Present ZEC  ZEC was constituted in terms of Chapter 12 Section 238 of the Constitution of Zimbabwe. There are nine Commissioners, who hold office for a term of six years. There is a Chairperson and a Deputy-Chairperson both of whom are appointed on a full time basis. Four of the eight Commissioners other than the Chairperson must be women.  The Chairperson is appointed by the President after consultation with the Judicial Service Commission and the Parliamentary Committee on Standing Rules and Orders. The Chairperson must be a judge or former judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court, or a person qualified for appointment as such the other eight members are appointed by the President from a list of not fewer than twelve nominees submitted by the Parliamentary Committee on Standing Rules and Orders.  In respect of the eight Commissioners appointed under this new system, the Parliamentary Committee on Standing Rules and Orders first invites applications for these posts. It then shortlists applicants. The shortlisted applicants are subjected to a vigorous public interview process by a panel of Parliamentarians. The Constitution provisions requires that Commissioners be chosen “for their integrity and their experience and competence in the conduct of affairs in the public or private sector.”",

At a polling station, the voter must prove his/her identity and citizenship of the Czech Republic with the necessary document. Each voter must vote in person; No proxy voting is allowed. The voter receives an empty official envelope, stamped with the official stamp of the district election commission. Upon request, the commission will also issue the voter a set of ballots.

The voter places one ballot for the candidate for whom she/he has decided to vote in the official envelope. The ballot cannot be modified in any way. The voter votes by inserting the official envelope with the selected ballot into the ballot box in front of the precinct election commission.

Secondly, a voter with permanent residence in the Czech Republic can vote at any embassy abroad using a standard absentee voting certificate which they apply for ahead of the election. The Ministry of Interior sends the ballot papers electronically to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which forwards them to the diplomatic missions no later than 3 days before the election day.

For the first round of the presidential election, maximum campaign expenses for each candidate are set at CZK 40 million, while the total expenses for each of the two candidates reaching a potential second round are set at CZK 50 million. The limits include in-kind donations and campaign expenses incurred by third parties (a third party can spend up to CZK 1,800,000 per campaign.) Contestants must open a dedicated bank account to carry out campaign-related transactions. Each contestant as well as third parties are subject to public disclosure of campaign income and expenses on their specially dedicated websites, including publication of detailed financial reports 90 days after the promulgation of the election results and submission of the reports to a supervisory body.

At the start of the current restructuring process, the Commission returned all its then Civil Servants to the Establishment Secretary’s Office.

The voter is then allowed to immediately vote unless the election official or any candidate agent present desires that the voter first be sworn. The presiding officer issues to the voter a ballot paper that has a detachable counterfoil attached with a number printed on the face of the ballot paper and has the poll clerks initials on the back. The presiding officer instructs the voter to mark the ballot with an \"X\" or to shade the designated oval sign, by referring the voter to a speciman ballot paper posted in a conspicuous place. The voter then immediately proceeds to vote in secret in a polling booth where the ballot is marked as instructed. The voter marks the ballot for up to five candidates - one vote in the local electoral district and up to four votes in the territorial-at-large district. Voters with a physical disability or blindness, or who are illiterate, may be assisted by the presiding officer to cast the ballot, upon the swearing of the required oath by such persons. After voting, the voter returns the ballot paper to the presiding officer, folded as instructed. In full view of all present, the presiding officer then removes the counterfoil and directs the voter to insert the ballot into the locked ballot box or into the electronic tabulation machine (ballot scanner), if being used at that polling station. If the voter inadvertently spoils the ballot paper, the presiding officer can issue another ballot paper and writes or stamps \"spoiled\" on the face of the spoiled ballot. The poll clerk then enters next to the voter's name in the (electronic) poll book, the word \"voted\". If at any point a voter has taken an oath or affirmation or refused to take an oath or affirm or to answer any question that the voter is legally required to do, this is to be noted in the (electronic) poll book. After voting, the voter must immediately leave the polling station."

            "details": "\n\n\t\n\n\n<p>Political parties that received more than three percent of the votes cast (six percent for coalition) in the previous Sejm elections are entitled to annual public funding. Each political party, coalition and voters' group that obtains at least one seat in the Sejm, Senat or European Palriament is eligible for a subsequent one-time state subsidy. The subsidy is proportionate to the number of mandates obtained and is calculated on the basis of the entity's campaign expenses, which are not to exceed the spending limit. All campaigns must be financed through electoral committees; voters' electoral committees may be financed from private donations or loans, while party and coalition electoral committees are financed only from the designated electoral funds of political parties. The law permits candidates' contributions (up to 45 times the minimum monthly salary) as well as private donations from citizens&nbsp; with permanent domicile in the country (up to 15 times the minimum monthly salary). Anonymous donations and contributions from foreign sources and legal entities are prohibited. Electoral committees may accept in-kind contributions to their campaigns from individuals. There is no obligation for interim financial reporting to any institutions during elections. However, all electoral committees are required to declare, on their websites, loans and private donations exceeding one minimum monthly salary every sevens days of receipt subject to a fine for non-compliance. Sources of funding of politcal parties' electoral funds are reported only within the parties' annual reports submitted to the National Election Commission (NEC). Failure to submit the annual report is subject to deregistration of the party. A spending limit is calculated for each electoral committee based on the number of registered voters and the number of mandates contested by that committee. An electoral committee that fields candidates in all constituencies is allowed to spend up to PLN 26.1 million in Sejm elections and PLN 5.7 million in Senat elections. An electoral committee's spending on campaign advertising may not exceed 80 percent of the expenditure limit. Third parties (other than voters) must receive the consent of an electoral committee in order to campaign, although there is no sanction for doing so without consent and there is no clear regulation on the reporting of third party contributions.&nbsp; The NEC exercises oversight over party and campaign financing. Electoral Committees must submit financial reports on campaign income and expenditures, together with an external audit of the financial report, to the NEC within three months of the elections. Rejection of the report by teh NEC on the basis of detected violations of campaign finance regulations leads to a decrease in state subsidies, as well as other sanctions of specific irregularities. The amount of subsidies for the respective party is decreased by threefold the amount of incorrectly spent or received funding, up to 75 percent of the total due amount of the subsidy. Parties whose annual financial reports are rejected by the SEC for any type of irregularities are deprived of public funding for three years.&nbsp; The current oversight system lacks mechanisms to monitor and investigate potential violations during the campaign, such as undisclosed spending and misuse of public resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n"

Under the Elections Commission Act (2008) 5 members are appointed by the president for a 5 year term with approval by People’s Majlis.  Prior to the establishment of the transitional Elections Commission on 6 September 2008 as stated in article 276 of the 2008 Constitution of the Republic of Maldives, elections were formerly coordinated by the Commissioner of Elections office which had first functioned under the Ministry of Home Affairs, and later under the purview of the President’s Office. The then Commissioner of Elections, was appointed by the President. The Commissioner of Elections was answerable to the President only and could only be removed from office by the President.  The need for an independent Elections Commission was recognized during 2004 when a series of reforms were introduced to strengthen democracy in the country. One of the key aspects of these reforms was to modernize the electoral system, ensuring that elections were conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner, and develop a functioning multi-party system in the Maldives.  Subsequently, under the 2008 Constitution of the Republic of Maldives, the Elections Commission was established as an independent and impartial institution, that will function in accordance with the Constitution and laws enacted by the People’s Majlis’ and the statue governing the responsibilities, powers and mandate of the Elections Commission.",

Overseas voting will takeplace in person at polling stations which will be set up in embassies, consulates and suitable venues of Greek disaspora organizations. For an out-of-country polling station to be constituted, a minimum of 40 registered voters is required. On the day appointed for voting, voters come to the polling station of the relevant electoral division and present themselves to the electoral commitee, which determines their identity based on their Greeck police ID or Greek passport, and verifies their registration in the foreign voter list. To each voter, the electoral committee delivers an envelope initialed by the representative of the judicial authority and sealed with a stamp of the committee, a complete set of ballot forms and a blank ballot. Then the voter proceeds to the special separate area, in such a way that he/she cannot be seen, and there the voter secretly inserts the ballot paper of his choosing in the envelope given to him/her by the election committee. After securely sealing the envelope, the voter returns to the election committee and shows the envelope to the members and other attendees, to show that he/she is holding only one envelope, and then inserts the envelope into the ballot box. The election committee draws up minutes during the voting for every matter related to its conduct.\n\nThe 2023 elections will be the first time that certain out-of-country Greek citizens will be able to vote abroad.  According to legislation adopted in December 2019, after the 2019 parliamentary elections,  registered voters who are temporarily or permanently abroad must fulfil two main requirements in order to vote abroad. They must have had a two-year stay in Greece in the last 35 years and for those over 30 years old they  must have filed  a tax return in Greece in the year of the election or the preceding year."

The circumstances are: the voter presenting a valid voter identification card for that polling place and which does not indicate that the person has already voted; the voter's name appears on the national voter register but is not on the signature list at that polling place in the election district where he or she resides and has voted in at least one prior election and is not listed in any other polling place; the voter's name appears on the national voter register and on a signature list of a polling place in an election district where he or she does not reside and the voter did not apply for absentee voting. Any election board member, poll watcher or registered voter may challenge the identity or eligibility to vote of any person that appears at the polling place to vote on election day, by fileing an oral or written complaint. The board member is to give the challenged voter time to present witnesses and an explanation, if any, provided the decision is made prior to the close of polls. The decision may be appealed to the national election commissioner of the respective state, whose decision can be further appealed to the national election director. An election board member must record in the official log book for the polling place, the identifying informaton of any person who is not allowed to cast a ballot, and the reason for the disallowance. The person not allowed to vote shall then sign the log book next to the entry. The election legislation does not elaborate the procedures for the manner of voting, other than stating that all national elections shall be by secret ballot, which may be included in regulations issued by the national election board. The election law does provide that write-in votes may be used in national elections, whereby any name written upon a ballot shall be counted as a vote for that person. The law further provides that any voter who spoils a ballot may return it to a member of the election board and receive another one in its place, provided that the number of ballots given to him or her does not exceed three in all. Mobile voting also takes place on election day (or the day before the election day), whereby voters who are confined to their homes, hospitals or places of incarceration can submit a written request not more than 120 days before election day to vote at their place of confinement. If the voter is unable to personally complete or deliver the request form then the voter can request the assistance of a family  member. Mobile voters must vote in their place of confinement in secrecy, but any mobile voter who, by reason of physical disability, is unable to mark their ballot, is authorized to receive assistance to mark it.  Mobile voters and the election officials who assist these voters to vote may be required to submit an affidavit or other written statements to the national election director."

Electors vote first in the primary elections among their chiefdom's candidates and then on another day in the secondary elections among the winning chiefdom candidates within that constituency. Voting is only in person. On arrival at the polling station, a voter presents his/her voter ID card to an election official. The official then checks for the voter's name in the voter register. If the voter is registered but does not have a voter card, he/she must prove to the presiding officer that he/she is the one whose name appears on the voter register. The election official is also required to determine that the voter has not already voted in the election by checking that the voter's name is not marked off the voter register (in past elections, indelible ink on the index finger has also been used). Next, the election official issues the voter an ordinary ballot. A  tendered ballot is issued if the voter's name on the register is already marked as voted and the voter properly answers a set of specified questions and makes and signs a declaration that he/she has not already voted (the voter's registration number is put on the back of the tendered ballot and entered on the tendered ballots register).  The presiding officer can refuse to issue a ballot paper to the voter if an objection by declarationn on oath is made by a candidate, agent or voter on grounds that the person is impersonating a dead or incapacitated voter and the election officer is not satisfied of the person's claimed identity; the refusal can be appealed to the returning officer. Next, the election official calls out the number of the voter on the voter register, enters the number in the space provided on the counterfoil of the issued ballot, tears out the ballot paper and marks it with the official mark on the back of the ballot, folds the ballot paper in four so that the face of the ballot is on the inside and the official mark on the outside, then unfolds it and hands it to the voter, and draws a line in red ink through the number and name or photograph of the voter in the voter register as evidence that the ballot has been issued. Voting is by secret ballot in both primary and secondary elections. The voter goes immediately with the ballot paper to an unoccupied polling booth and in secret puts a marks on the picture of one candidate of his/her choice. The voter then folds the ballot so that the face of it is on the inside and places it in the respective ballot box. If the election officer has any doubt that the ballot was not the one issued at the polling station, he/she may require the voter to show the presiding officer the number and official mark on the back of the ballot paper before it is inserted in the ballot box.  Tendered ballots are placed the presiding officer in a separate envelope. Any voter who is illiterate or has a physical disability can request the presiding officer to assist or to allow a person accompanying that voter to assist him/her cast a ballot. The assisting person is bound to keep the secrecy of the vote. The presiding officer is to record in the voter register that the voter has been assisted by him/her or an accompanying person and the reason for doing so. A voter who inadvertently spoils his/his ballot paper may return it to the presiding officer for a new ballot paper. After voting, a voter must immediately leave the polling station."

Article 154 of the Constitution establishes the Commission, which is made up of twenty-one members. The chairperson is nominated by civil society and his/her appointment is ratified by the National Assembly. The other Commissioners are jointly designated by different entities from the Inter-Congolese Dialogue and must also be ratified by the National Assembly. The Commissioners are appointed for the duration of the transition period and can only be removed from office for failure to discharge their functions, misappropriation of public funds or conviction of high treason or corruption. The Commission has a Plenary Assembly which is responsible for its management. This Assembly consists of the chairperson and seven other Commissioners. The latter supervise different special units within the Commission while the chairperson is the overall supervisor of these special units. These special units of the commission are divided into: Electoral and civic education; Voters and candidates registration; Logistics; Electoral training; Legal and contentious matters; Polling operations and collecting results; Communication and public relations. The Constitution grants the Commission legal personality and further provides that it shall be autonomous and impartial in the performance of its mandate. Article 6 of the Constitution spells out the functions of the Commission. It is tasked with the responsibility to freely and fairly conduct and supervise elections during the transition period. In addition to administrative autonomy, the Constitution also guarantees the Commission financial autonomy. The Commission has its own budget. CENI is an organization of independent Congolese public law; it is neutral and has legal personality. It has administrative and financial autonomy. It has its own budget and employment of staff may be supplemented by external inputs. The Independent National Electoral Commission has the independence of action in relation to the other institutions of the Republic.

The number and offices of the overseas polling stations  are determined by the minister of foreign affairs in consultation with the National Election Commission, on the basis of establishing a polling station where there are at least 15 registered voters and establishing at least one polling station within the territorial responsiblity of the consultate to facilitate postal voting. Voters living abroad and holding a valid Polish passport (or valid ID in countries where Polish citizens can enter with only a Polish ID card) can be entered into the voter list compiled by the respective consulate, based on personal application lodged verbally, in writing, or by phone, fax or electronically. The foreign ministry, in consultaton with the National Election Commission, is to issue a regulation that will ensure that an overseas voter is entered on only one voter list.  Voters in possession of an absentee voting certificate issued in Poland can vote abroad at any polling station.  Citizens permanently living abroad can be entered on the voter list of a consultate on election, provided the voter presents proof of permament residence abroad in which case the commission places its seal and date of votong on the free page of the passport dedicated to visas and enters the passport number and validity date in the remarks section of the voter list.  The in-person oveseas voting process is the same as for in-country voting, except for the Polish passport requirement in countries where Polish citizens cannot enter without a passport and proxy voting is not permitted in overseas voting. For overseas postal voting, the voting package includes an addressed return envelope, the ballot paper(s), a ballot paper envelope, a statement of personal and secret casting of the vote, and voting instructions. The postal voter is to mark the ballot, and insert the marked ballot into the ballot paper envelope, seal the envelope and insert it into the return envelope together with the signed declaration (a statement of personal and secret casting of the vote) and return it by mail at his or her own cost to the address of the consul. Voters can also deliver the postal vote in the envelope in person to the respective consul.

            "details": "\n\n\t\n\n\n<p lang=\"EN-US\">Political parties that received more than three percent of the votes cast (six percent for coalition) in the previous Sejm elections are entitled to annual public funding. Each political party, coalition and voters' group that obtains at least one seat in the Sejm, Senat or European Palriament is eligible for a subsequent one-time state subsidy. The subsidy is proportionate to the number of mandates obtained and is calculated on the basis of the entity's campaign expenses, which are not to exceed the spending limit. All campaigns must be financed through electoral committees; voters' electoral committees may be financed from private donations or loans, while party and coalition electoral committees are financed only from the designated electoral funds of political parties. The law permits candidates' contributions (up to 45 times the minimum monthly salary) as well as private donations from citizens&nbsp; with permanent domicile in the country (up to 15 times the minimum monthly salary). Anonymous donations and contributions from foreign sources and legal entities are prohibited. Electoral committees may accept in-kind contributions to their campaigns from individuals. There is no obligation for interim financial reporting to any institutions during elections. However, all electoral committees are required to declare, on their websites, loans and private donations exceeding one minimum monthly salary every sevens days of receipt subject to a fine for non-compliance. Sources of funding of politcal parties' electoral funds are reported only within the parties' annual reports submitted to the National Election Commission (NEC). Failure to submit the annual report is subject to deregistration of the party. A spending limit is calculated for each electoral committee based on the number of registered voters and the number of mandates contested by that committee. An electoral committee that fields candidates in all constituencies is allowed to spend up to PLN 26.1 million in Sejm elections and PLN 5.7 million in Senat elections. An electoral committee's spending on campaign advertising may not exceed 80 percent of the expenditure limit. Third parties (other than voters) must receive the consent of an electoral committee in order to campaign, although there is no sanction for doing so without consent and there is no clear regulation on the reporting of third party contributions.&nbsp; The NEC exercises oversight over party and campaign financing. Electoral Committees must submit financial reports on campaign income and expenditures, together with an external audit of the financial report, to the NEC within three months of the elections. Rejection of the report by teh NEC on the basis of detected violations of campaign finance regulations leads to a decrease in state subsidies, as well as other sanctions of specific irregularities. The amount of subsidies for the respective party is decreased by threefold the amount of incorrectly spent or received funding, up to 75 percent of the total due amount of the subsidy. Parties whose annual financial reports are rejected by the SEC for any type of irregularities are deprived of public funding for three years.&nbsp; The current oversight system lacks mechanisms to monitor and investigate potential violations during the campaign, such as undisclosed spending and misuse of public resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n"

A new electoral management structure was established consisting of the Delimitation Commission, responsible for the delimitation of electoral districts, and the Electoral Supervisory Commission (ESC), charged with supervising the conduct of elections. The management of elections was done at this stage by the Registrar-General of Elections under the supervision of the ESC. The Registrar-General registered voters and compiled voter registers, conducted the voting process and the counting and collation of votes, and announced the results of the election. The Election Directorate provided logistical support to the Registrar-General in the management of the electoral process.\n\n2004 Restructuring\n\nIn 2004 the electoral management system was re-structured. This re-structuring was based on recommendations by the Electoral Supervisory Commission, by the political parties and by civil society organisations. The reforms also took account of the Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections adopted by the SADC Heads of State and Governments in Mauritius in 2004. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) was then established as an independent body in line with the recommendation in the SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections that elections should be run by an independent management body and not by a government department like that of the Registrar-General.\n\nThe Electoral Supervisory Commission was then abolished in 2005 by Constitutional Amendment No. 17. ZEC became the body responsible for running elections and this function was no longer performed by the Registrar-General. To reflect the new system, the title of the Registrar-General of Elections was changed to that of the Registrar-General of Voters. The function of the Registrar-General of Voters in relation to elections was now only to register voters under the supervision of ZEC. ZEC was responsible for compiling voters rolls and providing copies of these rolls to those requesting them.\n\nThe Present ZEC\n\nZEC was constituted in terms of Chapter 12 Section 238 of the Constitution of Zimbabwe. There are nine Commissioners, who hold office for a term of six years. There is a Chairperson and a Deputy-Chairperson both of whom are appointed on a full time basis. Four of the eight Commissioners other than the Chairperson must be women.\n\nThe Chairperson is appointed by the President after consultation with the Judicial Service Commission and the Parliamentary Committee on Standing Rules and Orders. The Chairperson must be a judge or former judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court, or a person qualified for appointment as such the other eight members are appointed by the President from a list of not fewer than twelve nominees submitted by the Parliamentary Committee on Standing Rules and Orders.\n\nIn respect of the eight Commissioners appointed under this new system, the Parliamentary Committee on Standing Rules and Orders first invites applications for these posts. It then shortlists applicants. The shortlisted applicants are subjected to a vigorous public interview process by a panel of Parliamentarians. The Constitution provisions requires that Commissioners be chosen “for their integrity and their experience and competence in the conduct of affairs in the public or pri",

Prior to the creation of the National Electoral Chamber in 1962, Decree 11.976/45 was issued during the de facto government, which approved the \"Organic Statute of the Political Parties and established the creation of the \"Federal Electoral Court\".  However, the referred Statute was repealed and the Federal Electoral Court -whose members had resigned in full two days before- was dissolved. In 1962, by decree 7.163/62 the National Electoral Chamber was created.  This regulation placed special emphasis on the \"convenience of having a specialized court in charge of resolving the issues arising from the application of the electoral and political parties laws\".  Thus, and even with some differences with the current regime, the National Electoral Chamber was created. At that time, the Court was composed of five judges and an attorney general, and its presidency was permanent.  The following year, it was established -by decree-law 6.407/63- that the National Electoral Justice \"would integrate the Judicial Power of the Nation, as a court specialized in legal-political and electoral matters\".  It was also established that the National Electoral Chamber would act as \"court of appeal with respect to the national electoral judges\".  The creation of the electoral jurisdiction was later ratified by law 16.478 -which provided that the decrees issued with force of law by the de facto government, between March 29, 1962 and October 12, 1963, would continue to be in force- and, fundamentally, through the sanction of law 16.652.  This 1964 law provided for the intervention of the National Electoral Justice in all matters relating to the organization, recognition, operation and expiration of political parties, as well as in all contentious issues arising from the application of such law.  It should be recalled that by virtue of the coup d'état of June 28, 1966, the dissolution of the political parties was decreed. Months later, Law 17.014 was enacted, which determined the legal suppression of the National Electoral Chamber.  The magistrates of the National Electoral Chamber became judges of the National Chamber of Appeals for Peace and the National Chamber of Appeals for Economic Criminal Matters.  The electoral secretariats changed their name to \"Registries of Enrollment Records\" and the then National Registry of Enrollment as well as the Registry of Letters of Citizenship were in charge of the National Court of First Instance in Federal Criminal and Correctional Matters No. 1 of the Federal Capital. In 1971, Law 19,108 was enacted to create an \"Electoral Chamber\" within the National Court of Appeals in Federal and Contentious-Administrative Matters of the Federal Capital.  Subsequently, by virtue of the enactment of Law 19.277, and prior to the appointment of its members, the \"Electoral Chamber\" was transformed into the National Electoral Chamber, with its current structure of three judges forming a single chamber.
